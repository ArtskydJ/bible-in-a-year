		<span class="reference">Deuteronomy 33-34</span>  <span class="chapter">33</span><span class="verse">1</span> This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.   <span class="verse">2</span> He said,  “Yahweh came from Sinai,  and rose from Seir to them.  He shone from Mount Paran.  He came from the ten thousands of holy ones.  At his right hand was a fiery law for them. <span class="verse">3</span> Yes, he loves the people.  All his saints are in your hand.  They sat down at your feet.  Each receives your words.  <span class="verse">4</span> Moses commanded us a law,  an inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.  <span class="verse">5</span> He was king in Jeshurun,  when the heads of the people were gathered,  all the tribes of Israel together.  <span class="verse">6</span> “Let Reuben live, and not die;  Nor let his men be few.”  <span class="verse">7</span> This is for Judah. He said,  “Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah.  Bring him in to his people.  With his hands he contended for himself.  You shall be a help against his adversaries.”  <span class="verse">8</span> About Levi he said,  “Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one,  whom you proved at Massah,  with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah.  <span class="verse">9</span> He said of his father, and of his mother, ‘I have not seen him.’  He didn’t acknowledge his brothers,  nor did he know his own children;  for they have observed your word,  and keep your covenant.  <span class="verse">10</span> They shall teach Jacob your ordinances,  and Israel your law.  They shall put incense before you,  and whole burnt offering on your altar.  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh, bless his skills.  Accept the work of his hands.  Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,  of those who hate him, that they not rise again.”  <span class="verse">12</span> About Benjamin he said,  “The beloved of Yahweh will dwell in safety by him.  He covers him all day long.  He dwells between his shoulders.”  <span class="verse">13</span> About Joseph he said,  “His land is blessed by Yahweh,  for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew,  for the deep that couches beneath,  <span class="verse">14</span> for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,  for the precious things that the moon can yield,  <span class="verse">15</span> for the best things of the ancient mountains,  for the precious things of the everlasting hills,  <span class="verse">16</span> for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,  the good will of him who lived in the bush. Let this come on the head of Joseph,  on the crown of the head of him who was separated from his brothers.  <span class="verse">17</span> Majesty belongs to the firstborn of his herd.  His horns are the horns of the wild ox.  With them he will push all the peoples to the ends of the earth.  They are the ten thousands of Ephraim.  They are the thousands of Manasseh.”  <span class="verse">18</span> About Zebulun he said,  “Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;  and Issachar, in your tents.  <span class="verse">19</span> They will call the peoples to the mountain.  There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness,  for they will draw out the abundance of the seas,  the hidden treasures of the sand.”  <span class="verse">20</span> About Gad he said,  “He who enlarges Gad is blessed.  He dwells as a lioness,  and tears the arm and the crown of the head.  <span class="verse">21</span> He provided the first part for himself,  for the lawgiver’s portion reserved was reserved for him.  He came with the heads of the people.  He executed the righteousness of Yahweh,  His ordinances with Israel.”  <span class="verse">22</span> About Dan he said,  “Dan is a lion’s cub  that leaps out of Bashan.”  <span class="verse">23</span> About Naphtali he said,  “Naphtali, satisfied with favor,  full of Yahweh’s blessing,  Possess the west and the south.”  <span class="verse">24</span> About Asher he said,  “Asher is blessed with children.  Let him be acceptable to his brothers.  Let him dip his foot in oil.  <span class="verse">25</span> Your bars will be iron and bronze.  As your days, so your strength will be.  <span class="verse">26</span> “There is no one like God, Jeshurun,  who rides on the heavens for your help,  in his excellency on the skies.  <span class="verse">27</span> The eternal God is your dwelling place.  Underneath are the everlasting arms.  He thrust out the enemy from before you,  and said, ‘Destroy!’  <span class="verse">28</span> Israel dwells in safety,  the fountain of Jacob alone,  In a land of grain and new wine.  Yes, his heavens drop down dew.  <span class="verse">29</span> You are happy, Israel!  Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,  the shield of your help,  the sword of your excellency?  Your enemies will submit themselves to you.  You will tread on their high places.”   <span class="chapter">34</span><span class="verse">1</span> Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead to Dan,   <span class="verse">2</span> and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the Western Sea,   <span class="verse">3</span> and the south,  and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.   <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.”  <span class="verse">5</span> So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to Yahweh’s word.   <span class="verse">6</span> He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor, but no man knows where his tomb is to this day.   <span class="verse">7</span> Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his strength gone.   <span class="verse">8</span> The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.   <span class="verse">9</span> Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. The children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.   <span class="verse">10</span> Since then, there has not arisen a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face,   <span class="verse">11</span> in all the signs and the wonders which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,   <span class="verse">12</span> and in all the mighty hand, and in all the awesome deeds, which Moses did in the sight of all Israel.

Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.  <span class="verse">18</span> Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don’t forsake me,  until I have declared your strength to the next generation,  your might to everyone who is to come.  <span class="verse">19</span> Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens;  you have done great things.

This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today.  <span class="verse">16</span> But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.   <span class="verse">17</span> When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.   <span class="verse">18</span> Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying,  “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.  <span class="verse">19</span> Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,  <span class="verse">20</span> teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”  Amen.

Greet Epaenetus, my beloved, who is the first fruits of Achaia to Christ.   <span class="verse">6</span> Greet Mary, who labored much for us.   <span class="verse">7</span> Greet Andronicus and Junia, my relatives and my fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, who were also in Christ before me.   <span class="verse">8</span> Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.   <span class="verse">9</span> Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.   <span class="verse">10</span> Greet Apelles, the approved in Christ.
