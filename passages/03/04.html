These were the princes of the tribes. These are they who were over those who were counted;   <span class="verse">3</span> and they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered wagons and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox. They presented them before the tabernacle.   <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">5</span> “Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.   <span class="verse">7</span> He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service.   <span class="verse">8</span> He gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.   <span class="verse">9</span> But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried it on their shoulders.  <span class="verse">10</span> The princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed.

My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast!” ’  <span class="verse">5</span> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise,  <span class="verse">6</span> and the rest grabbed his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.  <span class="verse">7</span> When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. <span class="verse">8</span> “Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy.  <span class="verse">9</span> Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the wedding feast.’  <span class="verse">10</span> Those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests.  <span class="verse">11</span> But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing,  <span class="verse">12</span> and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He was speechless.  <span class="verse">13</span> Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness.
