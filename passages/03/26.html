		<span class="reference">Deuteronomy 22-24</span>  <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">1</span> You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep go astray and hide yourself from them. You shall surely bring them again to your brother.   <span class="verse">2</span> If your brother isn’t near to you, or if you don’t know him, then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall be with you until your brother comes looking for it, and you shall restore it to him.   <span class="verse">3</span> So you shall do with his donkey. So you shall do with his garment. So you shall do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost and you have found. You may not hide yourself.   <span class="verse">4</span> You shall not see your brother’s donkey or his ox fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them. You shall surely help him to lift them up again.  <span class="verse">5</span> A woman shall not wear men’s clothing, neither shall a man put on women’s clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God.  <span class="verse">6</span> If you come across a bird’s nest on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the hen with the young.   <span class="verse">7</span> You shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take for yourself, that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.  <span class="verse">8</span> When you build a new house, then you shall make a railing around your roof, so that you don’t bring blood on your house if anyone falls from there.  <span class="verse">9</span> You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest all the fruit be defiled, the seed which you have sown, and the increase of the vineyard.   <span class="verse">10</span> You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.   <span class="verse">11</span> You shall not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.  <span class="verse">12</span> You shall make yourselves fringes  on the four corners of your cloak with which you cover yourself.  <span class="verse">13</span> If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, hates her,   <span class="verse">14</span> accuses her of shameful things, gives her a bad name, and says, “I took this woman, and when I came near to her, I didn’t find in her the tokens of virginity;”   <span class="verse">15</span> then the young lady’s father and mother shall take and bring the tokens of the young lady’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate.   <span class="verse">16</span> The young lady’s father shall tell the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man as his wife, and he hates her.   <span class="verse">17</span> Behold, he has accused her of shameful things, saying, ‘I didn’t find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;’ and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.” They shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.   <span class="verse">18</span> The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him.   <span class="verse">19</span> They shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver,  and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has given a bad name to a virgin of Israel. She shall be his wife. He may not put her away all his days.  <span class="verse">20</span> But if this thing is true, that the tokens of virginity were not found in the young lady,   <span class="verse">21</span> then they shall bring out the young lady to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done folly in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father’s house. So you shall remove the evil from among you.  <span class="verse">22</span> If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both die, the man who lay with the woman and the woman. So you shall remove the evil from Israel.   <span class="verse">23</span> If there is a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married to a husband, and a man finds her in the city, and lies with her,   <span class="verse">24</span> then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones; the lady, because she didn’t cry, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor’s wife. So you shall remove the evil from among you.   <span class="verse">25</span> But if the man finds the lady who is pledged to be married in the field, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die;   <span class="verse">26</span> but to the lady you shall do nothing. There is in the lady no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter;   <span class="verse">27</span> for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married lady cried, and there was no one to save her.   <span class="verse">28</span> If a man finds a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged to be married, grabs her and lies with her, and they are found,   <span class="verse">29</span> then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady’s father fifty shekels  of silver. She shall be his wife, because he has humbled her. He may not put her away all his days.   <span class="verse">30</span> A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt.   <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> He who is emasculated by crushing or cutting shall not enter into Yahweh’s assembly.   <span class="verse">2</span> A person born of a forbidden union shall not enter into Yahweh’s assembly; even to the tenth generation shall no one of his enter into Yahweh’s assembly.   <span class="verse">3</span> An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into Yahweh’s assembly; even to the tenth generation shall no one belonging to them enter into Yahweh’s assembly forever,   <span class="verse">4</span> because they didn’t meet you with bread and with water on the way when you came out of Egypt, and because they hired against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you.   <span class="verse">5</span> Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn’t listen to Balaam, but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you, because Yahweh your God loved you.   <span class="verse">6</span> You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days forever.   <span class="verse">7</span> You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother. You shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner in his land.   <span class="verse">8</span> The children of the third generation who are born to them may enter into Yahweh’s assembly.  <span class="verse">9</span> When you go out and camp against your enemies, then you shall keep yourselves from every evil thing.   <span class="verse">10</span> If there is among you any man who is not clean by reason of that which happens to him by night, then shall he go outside of the camp. He shall not come within the camp;   <span class="verse">11</span> but it shall be, when evening comes, he shall bathe himself in water. When the sun is down, he shall come within the camp.   <span class="verse">12</span> You shall have a place also outside of the camp where you go relieve yourself.   <span class="verse">13</span> You shall have a trowel among your weapons. It shall be, when you relieve yourself, you shall dig with it, and shall turn back and cover your excrement;   <span class="verse">14</span> for Yahweh your God walks in the middle of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you. Therefore your camp shall be holy, that he may not see an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.  <span class="verse">15</span> You shall not deliver to his master a servant who has escaped from his master to you.   <span class="verse">16</span> He shall dwell with you, among you, in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best. You shall not oppress him.  <span class="verse">17</span> There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel, neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.   <span class="verse">18</span> You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages of a male prostitute,  into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow; for both of these are an abomination to Yahweh your God.  <span class="verse">19</span> You shall not lend on interest to your brother: interest of money, interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest.   <span class="verse">20</span> You may charge a foreigner interest; but you shall not your brother interest, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you go in to possess it.  <span class="verse">21</span> When you vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack to pay it, for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.   <span class="verse">22</span> But if you refrain from making a vow, it shall be no sin in you.   <span class="verse">23</span> You shall observe and do that which has gone out of your lips. Whatever you have vowed to Yahweh your God as a free will offering, which you have promised with your mouth, you must do.   <span class="verse">24</span> When you come into your neighbor’s vineyard, then you may eat your fill of grapes at your own pleasure; but you shall not put any in your container.   <span class="verse">25</span> When you come into your neighbor’s standing grain, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not use a sickle on your neighbor’s standing grain.   <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> When a man takes a wife and marries her, then it shall be, if she finds no favor in his eyes because he has found some unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a certificate of divorce, put it in her hand, and send her out of his house.   <span class="verse">2</span> When she has departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife.   <span class="verse">3</span> If the latter husband hates her, and write her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife;   <span class="verse">4</span> her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she is defiled; for that would be an abomination to Yahweh. You shall not cause the land to sin, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.   <span class="verse">5</span> When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army, neither shall he be assigned any business. He shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife whom he has taken.  <span class="verse">6</span> No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone as a pledge, for he takes a life in pledge.   <span class="verse">7</span> If a man is found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel, and he deals with him as a slave, or sells him, then that thief shall die. So you shall remove the evil from among you.   <span class="verse">8</span> Be careful in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently and do according to all that the Levitical priests teach you. As I commanded them, so you shall observe to do.   <span class="verse">9</span> Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you came out of Egypt.  <span class="verse">10</span> When you lend your neighbor any kind of loan, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge.   <span class="verse">11</span> You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the pledge outside to you.   <span class="verse">12</span> If he is a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge.   <span class="verse">13</span> You shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment and bless you. It shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.  <span class="verse">14</span> You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether he is one of your brothers or one of the foreigners who are in your land within your gates.   <span class="verse">15</span> In his day you shall give him his wages, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor and sets his heart on it; lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you.  <span class="verse">16</span> The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers. Every man shall be put to death for his own sin.  <span class="verse">17</span> You shall not deprive the foreigner or the fatherless of justice, nor take a widow’s clothing in pledge;   <span class="verse">18</span> but you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you there. Therefore I command you to do this thing.  <span class="verse">19</span> When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow, that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.   <span class="verse">20</span> When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs again. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.  <span class="verse">21</span> When you harvest your vineyard, you shall not glean it after yourselves. It shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.   <span class="verse">22</span> You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. Therefore I command you to do this thing.

Strengthen, God, that which you have done for us.  <span class="verse">29</span> Because of your temple at Jerusalem,  kings shall bring presents to you.  <span class="verse">30</span> Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds,  the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples.  Being humbled, may it bring bars of silver.  Scatter the nations that delight in war.  <span class="verse">31</span> Princes shall come out of Egypt.  Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God.  <span class="verse">32</span> Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!  Sing praises to the Lord!  <span class="verse">33</span> To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;  behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.  <span class="verse">34</span> Ascribe strength to God!  His excellency is over Israel,  his strength is in the skies.  <span class="verse">35</span> You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.  The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.  Praise be to God!

What evil has he done?”  But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be crucified!”  <span class="verse">24</span> So when Pilate saw that nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.”  <span class="verse">25</span> All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!”  <span class="verse">26</span> Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be crucified.   <span class="verse">27</span> Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered the whole garrison together against him.   <span class="verse">28</span> They stripped him, and put a scarlet robe on him.   <span class="verse">29</span> They braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”   <span class="verse">30</span> They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.   <span class="verse">31</span> When they had mocked him, they took the robe off him, and put his clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.

		<span class="reference">Romans 14:1-13</span>  <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now accept one who is weak in faith, but not for disputes over opinions.   <span class="verse">2</span> One man has faith to eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables.   <span class="verse">3</span> Don’t let him who eats despise him who doesn’t eat. Don’t let him who doesn’t eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him.   <span class="verse">4</span> Who are you who judge another’s servant? To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for God has power to make him stand.  <span class="verse">5</span> One man esteems one day as more important. Another esteems every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.   <span class="verse">6</span> He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He who doesn’t eat, to the Lord he doesn’t eat, and gives God thanks.   <span class="verse">7</span> For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.   <span class="verse">8</span> For if we live, we live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live or die, we are the Lord’s.   <span class="verse">9</span> For to this end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.  <span class="verse">10</span> But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.   <span class="verse">11</span> For it is written,  “ ‘As I live,’ says the Lord, ‘to me every knee will bow.  Every tongue will confess to God.’ ” <span class="verse">12</span> So then each one of us will give account of himself to God.  <span class="verse">13</span> Therefore let’s not judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother’s way, or an occasion for falling.
