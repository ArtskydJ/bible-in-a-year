As you are, so the foreigner shall be before Yahweh.   <span class="verse">16</span> One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.’ ”  <span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">18</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you,   <span class="verse">19</span> then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">20</span> Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering. As the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it.   <span class="verse">21</span> Of the first of your dough, you shall give to Yahweh a wave offering throughout your generations.  <span class="verse">22</span> “ ‘When you err, and don’t observe all these commandments which Yahweh has spoken to Moses—   <span class="verse">23</span> even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that Yahweh gave commandment and onward throughout your generations—   <span class="verse">24</span> then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, with its meal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.   <span class="verse">25</span> The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering before Yahweh, for their error.   <span class="verse">26</span> All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them; for with regard to all the people, it was done unwittingly.  <span class="verse">27</span> “ ‘If a person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering.   <span class="verse">28</span> The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs when he sins unwittingly before Yahweh. He shall make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven.   <span class="verse">29</span> You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.  <span class="verse">30</span> “ ‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, blasphemes Yahweh. That soul shall be cut off from among his people.   <span class="verse">31</span> Because he has despised Yahweh’s word, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall be utterly cut off. His iniquity shall be on him.’ ”  <span class="verse">32</span> While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.   <span class="verse">33</span> Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.   <span class="verse">34</span> They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.  <span class="verse">35</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp.”   <span class="verse">36</span> All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <span class="verse">37</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">38</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves fringes  on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe   of each border a cord of blue.   <span class="verse">39</span> It shall be to you for a fringe,  that you may see it, and remember all Yahweh’s commandments, and do them; and that you don’t follow your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to play the prostitute;   <span class="verse">40</span> so that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.   <span class="verse">41</span> I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Yahweh your God.”   <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took some men.   <span class="verse">2</span> They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown.   <span class="verse">3</span> They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Yahweh is among them! Why do you lift yourselves up above Yahweh’s assembly?”  <span class="verse">4</span> When Moses heard it, he fell on his face.   <span class="verse">5</span> He said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning, Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him.   <span class="verse">6</span> Do this: have Korah and all his company take censers,   <span class="verse">7</span> put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow. It shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!”  <span class="verse">8</span> Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi!   <span class="verse">9</span> Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of Yahweh’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;   <span class="verse">10</span> and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood also?   <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against Yahweh! What is Aaron that you complain against him?”  <span class="verse">12</span> Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We won’t come up!   <span class="verse">13</span> Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?   <span class="verse">14</span> Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won’t come up.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, “Don’t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company go before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.   <span class="verse">17</span> Each man take his censer and put incense on it, and each man bring before Yahweh his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each with his censer.”  <span class="verse">18</span> They each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.   <span class="verse">19</span> Korah assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the Tent of Meeting.  Yahweh’s glory appeared to all the congregation.   <span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,   <span class="verse">21</span> “Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!”  <span class="verse">22</span> They fell on their faces, and said, “God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?”  <span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">24</span> “Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!’ ”  <span class="verse">25</span> Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.   <span class="verse">26</span> He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!”  <span class="verse">27</span> So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.  <span class="verse">28</span> Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind.   <span class="verse">29</span> If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then Yahweh hasn’t sent me.   <span class="verse">30</span> But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol,  then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">31</span> As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split apart.   <span class="verse">32</span> The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their households, all of Korah’s men, and all their goods.   <span class="verse">33</span> So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol.   The earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.   <span class="verse">34</span> All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!”   <span class="verse">35</span> Fire came out from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.  <span class="verse">36</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">37</span> “Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy,   <span class="verse">38</span> even the censers of those who sinned against their own lives. Let them be beaten into plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before Yahweh. Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the children of Israel.”  <span class="verse">39</span> Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,   <span class="verse">40</span> to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger who isn’t of the offspring of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before Yahweh, that he not be as Korah, and as his company; as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.  <span class="verse">41</span> But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed Yahweh’s people!”  <span class="verse">42</span> When the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and Yahweh’s glory appeared.   <span class="verse">43</span> Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.   <span class="verse">44</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">45</span> “Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” They fell on their faces.  <span class="verse">46</span> Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it, lay incense on it, carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh! The plague has begun.”  <span class="verse">47</span> Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. The plague had already begun among the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.   <span class="verse">48</span> He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.   <span class="verse">49</span> Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, in addition to those who died about the matter of Korah.   <span class="verse">50</span> Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague was stopped.
