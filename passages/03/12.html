		<span class="reference">Numbers 23-25</span>  <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for me.”  <span class="verse">2</span> Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.   <span class="verse">3</span> Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.”  He went to a bare height.   <span class="verse">4</span> God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”  <span class="verse">6</span> He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.   <span class="verse">7</span> He took up his parable, and said,  “From Aram has Balak brought me,  the king of Moab from the mountains of the East.  Come, curse Jacob for me.  Come, defy Israel.  <span class="verse">8</span> How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?  How shall I defy whom Yahweh has not defied?  <span class="verse">9</span> For from the top of the rocks I see him.  From the hills I see him.  Behold, it is a people that dwells alone,  and shall not be listed among the nations.  <span class="verse">10</span> Who can count the dust of Jacob,  or count the fourth part of Israel?  Let me die the death of the righteous!  Let my last end be like his!”  <span class="verse">11</span> Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether.”  <span class="verse">12</span> He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?”  <span class="verse">13</span> Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them. You shall see just part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse them from there for me.”  <span class="verse">14</span> He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.   <span class="verse">15</span> He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet God over there.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and say this.”  <span class="verse">17</span> He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, “What has Yahweh spoken?”  <span class="verse">18</span> He took up his parable, and said,  “Rise up, Balak, and hear!  Listen to me, you son of Zippor.  <span class="verse">19</span> God is not a man, that he should lie,  nor a son of man, that he should repent.  Has he said, and will he not do it?  Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?  <span class="verse">20</span> Behold, I have received a command to bless.  He has blessed, and I can’t reverse it.  <span class="verse">21</span> He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.  Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel.  Yahweh his God is with him.  The shout of a king is among them.  <span class="verse">22</span> God brings them out of Egypt.  He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.  <span class="verse">23</span> Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob;  Neither is there any divination with Israel.  Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,  ‘What has God done!’  <span class="verse">24</span> Behold, a people rises up as a lioness.  As a lion he lifts himself up.  He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey,  and drinks the blood of the slain.”  <span class="verse">25</span> Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.”  <span class="verse">26</span> But Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?’ ”  <span class="verse">27</span> Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”  <span class="verse">28</span> Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.   <span class="verse">29</span> Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.”  <span class="verse">30</span> Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.   <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn’t go, as at the other times, to use divination, but he set his face toward the wilderness.   <span class="verse">2</span> Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.   <span class="verse">3</span> He took up his parable, and said,  “Balaam the son of Beor says,  the man whose eyes are open says;  <span class="verse">4</span> he says, who hears the words of God,  who sees the vision of the Almighty,  falling down, and having his eyes open:  <span class="verse">5</span> How goodly are your tents, Jacob,  and your dwellings, Israel!  <span class="verse">6</span> As valleys they are spread out,  as gardens by the riverside,  as aloes which Yahweh has planted,  as cedar trees beside the waters.  <span class="verse">7</span> Water shall flow from his buckets.  His seed shall be in many waters.  His king shall be higher than Agag.  His kingdom shall be exalted.  <span class="verse">8</span> God brings him out of Egypt.  He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.  He shall consume the nations his adversaries,  shall break their bones in pieces,  and pierce them with his arrows.  <span class="verse">9</span> He couched, he lay down as a lion,  as a lioness;  who shall rouse him up?  Everyone who blesses you is blessed.  Everyone who curses you is cursed.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.   <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore, flee to your place, now! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you back from honor.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,   <span class="verse">13</span> ‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond Yahweh’s word, to do either good or bad from my own mind. I will say what Yahweh says’?   <span class="verse">14</span> Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.”  <span class="verse">15</span> He took up his parable, and said,  “Balaam the son of Beor says,  the man whose eyes are open says;  <span class="verse">16</span> he says, who hears the words of God,  knows the knowledge of the Most High,  and who sees the vision of the Almighty,  Falling down, and having his eyes open:  <span class="verse">17</span> I see him, but not now.  I see him, but not near.  A star will come out of Jacob.  A scepter will rise out of Israel,  and shall strike through the corners of Moab,  and crush all the sons of Sheth.  <span class="verse">18</span> Edom shall be a possession.  Seir, his enemies, also shall be a possession,  while Israel does valiantly.  <span class="verse">19</span> Out of Jacob shall one have dominion,  and shall destroy the remnant from the city.”  <span class="verse">20</span> He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,  “Amalek was the first of the nations,  But his latter end shall come to destruction.”  <span class="verse">21</span> He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,  “Your dwelling place is strong.  Your nest is set in the rock.  <span class="verse">22</span> Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted,  until Asshur carries you away captive.”  <span class="verse">23</span> He took up his parable, and said,  “Alas, who shall live when God does this?  <span class="verse">24</span> But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim.  They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.  He also shall come to destruction.”  <span class="verse">25</span> Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.   <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">1</span> Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab;   <span class="verse">2</span> for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. The people ate and bowed down to their gods.   <span class="verse">3</span> Israel joined himself to Baal Peor, and Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel.   <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting.   <span class="verse">7</span> When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the middle of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.   <span class="verse">8</span> He went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stopped among the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">9</span> Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">11</span> “Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I didn’t consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.   <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.   <span class="verse">13</span> It shall be to him, and to his offspring after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’ ”  <span class="verse">14</span> Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house among the Simeonites.   <span class="verse">15</span> The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">17</span> “Harass the Midianites, and strike them;   <span class="verse">18</span> for they harassed you with their wiles, wherein they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the incident regarding Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.”

But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.  <span class="verse">23</span> “Then if any man tells you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There,’ don’t believe it.  <span class="verse">24</span> For there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones. <span class="verse">25</span> “Behold, I have told you beforehand.  <span class="verse">26</span> If therefore they tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ don’t go out; or ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ don’t believe it.  <span class="verse">27</span> For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.  <span class="verse">28</span> For wherever the carcass is, that is where the vultures gather together.
