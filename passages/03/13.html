To everyone according to those who were counted of him shall his inheritance be given.   <span class="verse">55</span> Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot. According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.   <span class="verse">56</span> According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer.”  <span class="verse">57</span> These are those who were counted of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites.   <span class="verse">58</span> These are the families of Levi: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, and the family of the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram.   <span class="verse">59</span> The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt. She bore to Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.   <span class="verse">60</span> To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.   <span class="verse">61</span> Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before Yahweh.   <span class="verse">62</span> Those who were counted of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward; for they were not counted among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">63</span> These are those who were counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who counted the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.   <span class="verse">64</span> But among these there was not a man of them who were counted by Moses and Aaron the priest, who counted the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.   <span class="verse">65</span> For Yahweh had said of them, “They shall surely die in the wilderness.” There was not a man left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.   <span class="chapter">27</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph came near. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.   <span class="verse">2</span> They stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the Tent of Meeting, saying,   <span class="verse">3</span> “Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Yahweh in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin. He had no sons.   <span class="verse">4</span> Why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession among the brothers of our father.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Moses brought their cause before Yahweh.   <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">7</span> “The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. You shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brothers. You shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.   <span class="verse">8</span> You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.   <span class="verse">9</span> If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.   <span class="verse">10</span> If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.   <span class="verse">11</span> If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it. This shall be a statute and ordinance for the children of Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses.’ ”  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Go up into this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">13</span> When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered;   <span class="verse">14</span> because in the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, to honor me as holy at the waters before their eyes.” (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.)  <span class="verse">15</span> Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying,   <span class="verse">16</span> “Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation,   <span class="verse">17</span> who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the congregation of Yahweh may not be as sheep which have no shepherd.”  <span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him.   <span class="verse">19</span> Set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and commission him in their sight.   <span class="verse">20</span> You shall give authority to him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey.   <span class="verse">21</span> He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.”  <span class="verse">22</span> Moses did as Yahweh commanded him. He took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation.   <span class="verse">23</span> He laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as Yahweh spoke by Moses.

		<span class="reference">Romans 7:1-12</span>  <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Or don’t you know, brothers  (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man for as long as he lives?   <span class="verse">2</span> For the woman that has a husband is bound by law to the husband while he lives, but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the law of the husband.   <span class="verse">3</span> So then if, while the husband lives, she is joined to another man, she would be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she is joined to another man.   <span class="verse">4</span> Therefore, my brothers, you also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you would be joined to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might produce fruit to God.   <span class="verse">5</span> For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions which were through the law worked in our members to bring out fruit to death.   <span class="verse">6</span> But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.  <span class="verse">7</span> What shall we say then? Is the law sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t have known sin, except through the law. For I wouldn’t have known coveting, unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.” <span class="verse">8</span> But sin, finding occasion through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.   <span class="verse">9</span> I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.   <span class="verse">10</span> The commandment which was for life, this I found to be for death;   <span class="verse">11</span> for sin, finding occasion through the commandment, deceived me, and through it killed me.   <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
