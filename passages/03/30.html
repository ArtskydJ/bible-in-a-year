		<span class="reference">Deuteronomy 32</span>  <span class="chapter">32</span><span class="verse">1</span> Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.  Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.  <span class="verse">2</span> My doctrine will drop as the rain.  My speech will condense as the dew,  as the misty rain on the tender grass,  as the showers on the herb.  <span class="verse">3</span> For I will proclaim Yahweh’s name.  Ascribe greatness to our God!  <span class="verse">4</span> The Rock: his work is perfect,  for all his ways are just.  A God of faithfulness who does no wrong,  just and right is he.  <span class="verse">5</span> They have dealt corruptly with him.  They are not his children, because of their defect.  They are a perverse and crooked generation.  <span class="verse">6</span> Is this the way you repay Yahweh,  foolish and unwise people?  Isn’t he your father who has bought you?  He has made you and established you.  <span class="verse">7</span> Remember the days of old.  Consider the years of many generations.  Ask your father, and he will show you;  your elders, and they will tell you.  <span class="verse">8</span> When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,  when he separated the children of men,  he set the bounds of the peoples  according to the number of the children of Israel.  <span class="verse">9</span> For Yahweh’s portion is his people.  Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.  <span class="verse">10</span> He found him in a desert land,  in the waste howling wilderness.  He surrounded him.  He cared for him.  He kept him as the apple of his eye.  <span class="verse">11</span> As an eagle that stirs up her nest,  that flutters over her young,  he spread abroad his wings,  he took them,  he bore them on his feathers.  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh alone led him.  There was no foreign god with him.  <span class="verse">13</span> He made him ride on the high places of the earth.  He ate the increase of the field.  He caused him to suck honey out of the rock,  oil out of the flinty rock;  <span class="verse">14</span> butter from the herd, and milk from the flock,  with fat of lambs,  rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,  with the finest of the wheat.  From the blood of the grape, you drank wine.  <span class="verse">15</span> But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.  You have grown fat.  You have grown thick.  You have become sleek.  Then he abandoned God who made him,  and rejected the Rock of his salvation.  <span class="verse">16</span> They moved him to jealousy with strange gods.  They provoked him to anger with abominations.  <span class="verse">17</span> They sacrificed to demons, not God,  to gods that they didn’t know,  to new gods that came up recently,  which your fathers didn’t dread.  <span class="verse">18</span> Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,  and have forgotten God who gave you birth.  <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh saw and abhorred,  because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.  <span class="verse">20</span> He said, “I will hide my face from them.  I will see what their end will be;  for they are a very perverse generation,  children in whom is no faithfulness.  <span class="verse">21</span> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.  They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.  I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.  I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.  <span class="verse">22</span> For a fire is kindled in my anger,  that burns to the lowest Sheol, devours the earth with its increase,  and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.  <span class="verse">23</span> “I will heap evils on them.  I will spend my arrows on them.  <span class="verse">24</span> They shall be wasted with hunger,  and devoured with burning heat  and bitter destruction.  I will send the teeth of animals on them,  with the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.  <span class="verse">25</span> Outside the sword will bereave,  and in the rooms,  terror on both young man and virgin,  the nursing infant with the gray-haired man.  <span class="verse">26</span> I said that I would scatter them afar.  I would make their memory to cease from among men;  <span class="verse">27</span> were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,  lest their adversaries should judge wrongly,  lest they should say, ‘Our hand is exalted,  Yahweh has not done all this.’ ”  <span class="verse">28</span> For they are a nation void of counsel.  There is no understanding in them.  <span class="verse">29</span> Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,  that they would consider their latter end!  <span class="verse">30</span> How could one chase a thousand,  and two put ten thousand to flight,  unless their Rock had sold them,  and Yahweh had delivered them up?  <span class="verse">31</span> For their rock is not as our Rock,  even our enemies themselves concede.  <span class="verse">32</span> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,  of the fields of Gomorrah.  Their grapes are poison grapes.  Their clusters are bitter.  <span class="verse">33</span> Their wine is the poison of serpents,  the cruel venom of asps.  <span class="verse">34</span> “Isn’t this laid up in store with me,  sealed up among my treasures?  <span class="verse">35</span> Vengeance is mine, and recompense,  at the time when their foot slides;  for the day of their calamity is at hand.  Their doom rushes at them.”  <span class="verse">36</span> For Yahweh will judge his people,  and have compassion on his servants,  when he sees that their power is gone;  that there is no one remaining, shut up or left at large.  <span class="verse">37</span> He will say, “Where are their gods,  the rock in which they took refuge;  <span class="verse">38</span> which ate the fat of their sacrifices,  and drank the wine of their drink offering?  Let them rise up and help you!  Let them be your protection.  <span class="verse">39</span> “See now that I myself am he.  There is no god with me.  I kill and I make alive.  I wound and I heal.  There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.  <span class="verse">40</span> For I lift up my hand to heaven and declare,  as I live forever,  <span class="verse">41</span> if I sharpen my glittering sword,  my hand grasps it in judgment;  I will take vengeance on my adversaries,  and will repay those who hate me.  <span class="verse">42</span> I will make my arrows drunk with blood.  My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,  from the head of the leaders of the enemy.”  <span class="verse">43</span> Rejoice, you nations, with his people,  for he will avenge the blood of his servants.  He will take vengeance on his adversaries,  and will make atonement for his land and for his people. <span class="verse">44</span> Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.   <span class="verse">45</span> Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel.   <span class="verse">46</span> He said to them, “Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you today, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.   <span class="verse">47</span> For it is no vain thing for you, because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.”  <span class="verse">48</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,   <span class="verse">49</span> “Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession.   <span class="verse">50</span> Die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people;   <span class="verse">51</span> because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness among the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">52</span> For you shall see the land from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel.”

Never let me be disappointed.  <span class="verse">2</span> Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.  Turn your ear to me, and save me.  <span class="verse">3</span> Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.  Give the command to save me,  for you are my rock and my fortress.  <span class="verse">4</span> Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,  from the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.  <span class="verse">5</span> For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh,  my confidence from my youth.  <span class="verse">6</span> I have relied on you from the womb.  You are he who took me out of my mother’s womb.  I will always praise you.  <span class="verse">7</span> I am a marvel to many,  but you are my strong refuge.  <span class="verse">8</span> My mouth shall be filled with your praise,  with your honor all day long.  <span class="verse">9</span> Don’t reject me in my old age.  Don’t forsake me when my strength fails.  <span class="verse">10</span> For my enemies talk about me.  Those who watch for my soul conspire together,  <span class="verse">11</span> saying, “God has forsaken him.  Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him.”  <span class="verse">12</span> God, don’t be far from me.  My God, hurry to help me.  <span class="verse">13</span> Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed.  Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.

Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.   <span class="verse">7</span> Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”  <span class="verse">8</span> They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.   <span class="verse">9</span> As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying,  “Rejoice!” They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.  <span class="verse">10</span> Then Jesus said to them,  “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers  that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”

For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while.   <span class="verse">25</span> But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.   <span class="verse">26</span> For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">27</span> Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in fleshly things.   <span class="verse">28</span> When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by way of you to Spain.   <span class="verse">29</span> I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the Good News of Christ.  <span class="verse">30</span> Now I beg you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,   <span class="verse">31</span> that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,   <span class="verse">32</span> that I may come to you in joy through the will of God, and together with you, find rest.   <span class="verse">33</span> Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
