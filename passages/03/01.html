You and Aaron shall count them by their divisions.   <span class="verse">4</span> With you there shall be a man of every tribe, each one head of his fathers’ house.   <span class="verse">5</span> These are the names of the men who shall stand with you:  Of Reuben: Elizur the son of Shedeur.  <span class="verse">6</span> Of Simeon: Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.  <span class="verse">7</span> Of Judah: Nahshon the son of Amminadab.  <span class="verse">8</span> Of Issachar: Nethanel the son of Zuar.  <span class="verse">9</span> Of Zebulun: Eliab the son of Helon.  <span

son of Deuel.  <span class="verse">15</span> Of Naphtali: Ahira the son of Enan.”  <span class="verse">16</span> These are those who were called of the congregation, the princes  of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads of the thousands of Israel.   <span class="verse">17</span> Moses and Aaron took these men who are mentioned by name.   <span class="verse">18</span> They assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month; and they declared their ancestry by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, one by one.   <span class="verse">19</span> As Yahweh commanded Moses, so he counted them in the wilderness of Sinai.  <span class="verse">20</span> The children of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, one by one, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">21</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Reuben, were forty-six thousand five hundred.  <span class="verse">22</span> Of the children of Simeon, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, those who were counted of it, according to the number of the names, one by one, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">23</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.  <span class="verse">24</span> Of the children of Gad, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">25</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Gad, were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.  <span class="verse">26</span> Of the children of Judah, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">27</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Judah, were seventy-four thousand six hundred.  <span class="verse">28</span> Of the children of Issachar, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">29</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Issachar, were fifty-four thousand four hundred.  <span class="verse">30</span> Of the children of Zebulun, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">31</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Zebulun, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.  <span class="verse">32</span> Of the children of Joseph: of the children of Ephraim, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">33</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand five hundred.  <span class="verse">34</span> Of the children of Manasseh, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">35</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Manasseh, were thirty-two thousand two hundred.  <span class="verse">36</span> Of the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">37</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Benjamin, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.  <span class="verse">38</span> Of the children of Dan, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">39</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Dan, were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.  <span class="verse">40</span> Of the children of Asher, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">41</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Asher, were forty-one thousand five hundred.  <span class="verse">42</span> Of the children of Naphtali, their generations, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war:   <span class="verse">43</span> those who were counted of them, of the tribe of Naphtali, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.  <span class="verse">44</span> These are those who were counted, whom Moses and Aaron counted, and the twelve men who were princes of Israel, each one for his fathers’ house.   <span class="verse">45</span> So all those who were counted of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war in Israel—   <span class="verse">46</span> all those who were counted were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.   <span class="verse">47</span> But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not counted among them.   <span class="verse">48</span> For Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">49</span> “Only the tribe of Levi you shall not count, neither shall you take a census of them among the children of Israel;   <span class="verse">50</span> but appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it.   <span class="verse">51</span> When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.   <span class="verse">52</span> The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their divisions.   <span class="verse">53</span> But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel. The Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle of the Testimony.”  <span class="verse">54</span> Thus the children of Israel did. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they did.   <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “The children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers’ houses. They shall encamp around the Tent of Meeting at a distance from it.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Those who encamp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their divisions. The prince of the children of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab.   <span class="verse">4</span> His division, and those who were counted of them, were seventy-four thousand six hundred.  <span class="verse">5</span> Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar. The prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar.   <span class="verse">6</span> His division, and those who were counted of it, were fifty-four thousand four hundred.  <span class="verse">7</span> The tribe of Zebulun: the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon.   <span class="verse">8</span> His division, and those who were counted of it, were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.  <span class="verse">9</span> All who were counted of the camp of Judah were one hundred eighty-six thousand four hundred, according to their divisions. They shall set out first.  <span class="verse">10</span> “On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their divisions. The prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.   <span class="verse">11</span> His division, and those who were counted of it, were forty-six thousand five hundred.  <span class="verse">12</span> “Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon. The prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.   <span class="verse">13</span> His division, and those who were counted of them, were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.  <span class="verse">14</span> “The tribe of Gad: the prince of the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.   <span class="verse">15</span> His division, and those who were counted of them, were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.  <span class="verse">16</span> “All who were counted of the camp of Reuben were one hundred fifty-one thousand four hundred fifty, according to their armies. They shall set out second.  <span class="verse">17</span> “Then the Tent of Meeting shall set out, with the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camps. As they encamp, so shall they set out, every man in his place, by their standards.  <span class="verse">18</span> “On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their divisions. The prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.   <span class="verse">19</span> His division, and those who were counted of them, were forty thousand five hundred.  <span class="verse">20</span> “Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh. The prince of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.   <span class="verse">21</span> His division, and those who were counted of them, were thirty-two thousand two hundred.  <span class="verse">22</span> “The tribe of Benjamin: the prince of the children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.   <span class="verse">23</span> His army, and those who were counted of them, were thirty-five thousand four hundred.  <span class="verse">24</span> “All who were counted of the camp of Ephraim were one hundred eight thousand one hundred, according to their divisions. They shall set out third.  <span class="verse">25</span> “On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their divisions. The prince of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.   <span class="verse">26</span> His division, and those who were counted of them, were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.  <span class="verse">27</span> “Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher. The prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ochran.   <span class="verse">28</span> His division, and those who were counted of them, were forty-one thousand and five hundred.  <span class="verse">29</span> “The tribe of Naphtali: the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.   <span class="verse">30</span> His division, and those who were counted of them, were fifty-three thousand four hundred.  <span class="verse">31</span> “All who were counted of the camp of Dan were one hundred fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They shall set out last by their standards.”  <span class="verse">32</span> These are those who were counted of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses. All who were counted of the camps according to their armies were six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty.   <span class="verse">33</span> But the Levites were not counted among the children of Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses.  <span class="verse">34</span> Thus the children of Israel did. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set out, everyone by their families, according to their fathers’ houses.

They were dismayed.  They hurried away.  <span class="verse">6</span> Trembling took hold of them there,  pain, as of a woman in travail.  <span class="verse">7</span> With the east wind, you break the ships of Tarshish.  <span class="verse">8</span> As we have heard, so we have seen,  in the city of Yahweh of Armies, in the city of our God.  God will establish it forever.  <span class="verse">9</span> We have thought about your loving kindness, God,  in the middle of your temple.  <span class="verse">10</span> As is your name, God,  so is your praise to the ends of the earth.  Your right hand is full of righteousness.  <span class="verse">11</span> Let Mount Zion be glad!  Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments.  <span class="verse">12</span> Walk about Zion, and go around her.  Number its towers.  <span class="verse">13</span> Notice her bulwarks.  Consider her palaces,  that you may tell it to the next generation.  <span class="verse">14</span> For this God is our God forever and ever.  He will be our guide even to death.

Did you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing babies you have perfected praise?’ ” <span class="verse">17</span> He left them, and went out of the city to Bethany, and camped there.   <span class="verse">18</span> Now in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry.   <span class="verse">19</span> Seeing a fig tree by the road, he came to it, and found nothing on it but leaves. He said to it,  “Let there be no fruit from you forever!”  Immediately the fig tree withered away.   <span class="verse">20</span> When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither away?”  <span class="verse">21</span> Jesus answered them,  “Most certainly I tell you, if you have faith, and don’t doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you told this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ it would be done.  <span class="verse">22</span> All things, whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”

As it is written, “But the righteous shall live by faith.”
