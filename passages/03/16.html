These are their journeys according to their starting points.   <span class="verse">3</span> They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover, the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians,   <span class="verse">4</span> while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, whom Yahweh had struck among them. Yahweh also executed judgments on their gods.   <span class="verse">5</span> The children of Israel traveled from Rameses, and encamped in Succoth.   <span class="verse">6</span> They traveled from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.   <span class="verse">7</span> They traveled from Etham, and turned back to Pihahiroth, which is before Baal Zephon, and they encamped before Migdol.   <span class="verse">8</span> They traveled from before Hahiroth, and crossed through the middle of the sea into the wilderness. They went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.   <span class="verse">9</span> They traveled from Marah, and came to Elim.

Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his. You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.  <span class="verse">55</span> “But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them will be like pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will harass you in the land in which you dwell.   <span class="verse">56</span> It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so I will do to you.”   <span class="chapter">34</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Command the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders),   <span class="verse">3</span> then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward.   <span class="verse">4</span> Your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and it shall pass southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go from there to Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon.   <span class="verse">5</span> The border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and it shall end at the sea.  <span class="verse">6</span> “ ‘For the western border, you shall have the great sea and its border. This shall be your west border.  <span class="verse">7</span> “ ‘This shall be your north border: from the great sea you shall mark out for yourselves Mount Hor.   <span class="verse">8</span> From Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath; and the border shall pass by Zedad.   <span class="verse">9</span> Then the border shall go to Ziphron, and it shall end at Hazar Enan. This shall be your north border.  <span class="verse">10</span> “ ‘You shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham.   <span class="verse">11</span> The border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain. The border shall go down, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward.   <span class="verse">12</span> The border shall go down to the Jordan, and end at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders around it.’ ”  <span class="verse">13</span> Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, “This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which Yahweh has commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;   <span class="verse">14</span> for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers’ houses, the tribe of the children of Gad according to their fathers’ houses, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.   <span class="verse">15</span> The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">17</span> “These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for inheritance: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.   <span class="verse">18</span> You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land for inheritance.   <span class="verse">19</span> These are the names of the men: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.   <span class="verse">20</span> Of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.   <span class="verse">21</span> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.   <span class="verse">22</span> Of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the son of Jogli.   <span class="verse">23</span> Of the children of Joseph: of the tribe of the children of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.   <span class="verse">24</span> Of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan.   <span class="verse">25</span> Of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the son of Parnach.   <span class="verse">26</span> Of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince, Paltiel the son of Azzan.   <span class="verse">27</span> Of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the son of Shelomi.   <span class="verse">28</span> Of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.”   <span class="verse">29</span> These are they whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

Restore us, again.  <span class="verse">2</span> You have made the land tremble.  You have torn it.  Mend its fractures,  for it quakes.  <span class="verse">3</span> You have shown your people hard things.

Then he went on his journey.  <span class="verse">16</span> Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.  <span class="verse">17</span> In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two.  <span class="verse">18</span> But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money. <span class="verse">19</span> “Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.  <span class="verse">20</span> He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents in addition to them.’ <span class="verse">21</span> “His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’ <span class="verse">22</span> “He also who got the two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents in addition to them.’  <span class="verse">23</span> “His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’ <span class="verse">24</span> “He also who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you didn’t sow, and gathering where you didn’t scatter.  <span class="verse">25</span> I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’ <span class="verse">26</span> “But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather where I didn’t scatter.  <span class="verse">27</span> You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.  <span class="verse">28</span> Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.  <span class="verse">29</span> For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away.  <span class="verse">30</span> Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

For who hopes for that which he sees?   <span class="verse">25</span> But if we hope for that which we don’t see, we wait for it with patience.  <span class="verse">26</span> In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don’t know how to pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can’t be uttered.   <span class="verse">27</span> He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit’s mind, because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.  <span class="verse">28</span> We know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose.   <span class="verse">29</span> For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. <span class="verse">30</span> Whom he predestined, those he also called. Whom he called, those he also justified. Whom he justified, those he also glorified.  <span class="verse">31</span> What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?   <span class="verse">32</span> He who didn’t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?   <span class="verse">33</span> Who could bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies.   <span class="verse">34</span> Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.  <span class="verse">35</span> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?   <span class="verse">36</span> Even as it is written,  “For your sake we are killed all day long.  We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” <span class="verse">37</span> No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.   <span class="verse">38</span> For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,   <span class="verse">39</span> nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from God’s love which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
