		<span class="reference">Hosea 13-14</span>  <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling.  He exalted himself in Israel,  but when he became guilty in Baal, he died.  <span class="verse">2</span> Now they sin more and more,  and have made themselves molten images of their silver,  even idols according to their own understanding,  all of them the work of the craftsmen.  They say of them, ‘They offer human sacrifice and kiss the calves.’  <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore they will be like the morning mist,  and like the dew that passes away early,  like the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor,  and like the smoke out of the chimney.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt;  and you shall acknowledge no god but me,  and besides me there is no savior.  <span class="verse">5</span> I knew you in the wilderness,  in the land of great drought.  <span class="verse">6</span> According to their pasture, so were they filled;  they were filled, and their heart was exalted.  Therefore they have forgotten me.  <span class="verse">7</span> Therefore I am like a lion to them.  Like a leopard, I will lurk by the path.  <span class="verse">8</span> I will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs,  and will tear the covering of their heart.  There I will devour them like a lioness.  The wild animal will tear them.  <span class="verse">9</span> You are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me,  against your help.  <span class="verse">10</span> Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities?  And your judges, of whom you said, ‘Give me a king and princes?’  <span class="verse">11</span> I have given you a king in my anger,  and have taken him away in my wrath.  <span class="verse">12</span> The guilt of Ephraim is stored up.  His sin is stored up.  <span class="verse">13</span> The sorrows of a travailing woman will come on him.  He is an unwise son;  for when it is time, he doesn’t come to the opening of the womb.  <span class="verse">14</span> I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will redeem them from death!  Death, where are your plagues?  Sheol, where is your destruction?  “Compassion will be hidden from my eyes.  <span class="verse">15</span> Though he is fruitful among his brothers, an east wind will come,  the breath of Yahweh coming up from the wilderness;  and his spring will become dry,  and his fountain will be dried up.  He will plunder the storehouse of treasure.  <span class="verse">16</span> Samaria will bear her guilt;  for she has rebelled against her God.  They will fall by the sword.  Their infants will be dashed in pieces,  and their pregnant women will be ripped open.”   <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> Israel, return to Yahweh your God;  for you have fallen because of your sin.  <span class="verse">2</span> Take words with you, and return to Yahweh.  Tell him, “Forgive all our sins,  and accept that which is good:  so we offer our lips like bulls.  <span class="verse">3</span> Assyria can’t save us.  We won’t ride on horses;  neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, ‘Our gods!’  for in you the fatherless finds mercy.”  <span class="verse">4</span> “I will heal their waywardness.  I will love them freely;  for my anger is turned away from him.  <span class="verse">5</span> I will be like the dew to Israel.  He will blossom like the lily,  and send down his roots like Lebanon.  <span class="verse">6</span> His branches will spread,  and his beauty will be like the olive tree,  and his fragrance like Lebanon.  <span class="verse">7</span> Men will dwell in his shade.  They will revive like the grain,  and blossom like the vine.  Their fragrance will be like the wine of Lebanon.  <span class="verse">8</span> Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols?  I answer, and will take care of him.  I am like a green cypress tree;  from me your fruit is found.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Who is wise, that he may understand these things?  Who is prudent, that he may know them?  For the ways of Yahweh are right,  and the righteous walk in them;  But the rebellious stumble in them.

		<span class="reference">Job 27</span>  <span class="chapter">27</span><span class="verse">1</span> Job again took up his parable, and said,  <span class="verse">2</span> “As God lives, who has taken away my right,  the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter  <span class="verse">3</span> (for the length of my life is still in me,  and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);  <span class="verse">4</span> surely my lips will not speak unrighteousness,  neither will my tongue utter deceit.  <span class="verse">5</span> Far be it from me that I should justify you.  Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.  <span class="verse">6</span> I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go.  My heart will not reproach me so long as I live.  <span class="verse">7</span> “Let my enemy be as the wicked.  Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.  <span class="verse">8</span> For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?  <span class="verse">9</span> Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?  <span class="verse">10</span> Will he delight himself in the Almighty,  and call on God at all times?  <span class="verse">11</span> I will teach you about the hand of God.  I will not conceal that which is with the Almighty.  <span class="verse">12</span> Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves;  why then have you become altogether vain?  <span class="verse">13</span> “This is the portion of a wicked man with God,  the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.  <span class="verse">14</span> If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword.  His offspring will not be satisfied with bread.  <span class="verse">15</span> Those who remain of him will be buried in death.  His widows will make no lamentation.  <span class="verse">16</span> Though he heap up silver as the dust,  and prepare clothing as the clay;  <span class="verse">17</span> he may prepare it, but the just will put it on,  and the innocent will divide the silver.  <span class="verse">18</span> He builds his house as the moth,  as a booth which the watchman makes.  <span class="verse">19</span> He lies down rich, but he will not do so again.  He opens his eyes, and he is not.  <span class="verse">20</span> Terrors overtake him like waters.  A storm steals him away in the night.  <span class="verse">21</span> The east wind carries him away, and he departs.  It sweeps him out of his place.  <span class="verse">22</span> For it hurls at him, and does not spare,  as he flees away from his hand.  <span class="verse">23</span> Men will clap their hands at him,  and will hiss him out of his place.

Remain in my love.  <span class="verse">10</span> If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and remain in his love.  <span class="verse">11</span> I have spoken these things to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be made full. <span class="verse">12</span> “This is my commandment, that you love one another, even as I have loved you.  <span class="verse">13</span> Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.  <span class="verse">14</span> You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.  <span class="verse">15</span> No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does.

Keep it and repent. If therefore you won’t watch, I will come as a thief, and you won’t know what hour I will come upon you.  <span class="verse">4</span> Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that didn’t defile their garments. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.  <span class="verse">5</span> He who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments, and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.  <span class="verse">6</span> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. <span class="verse">7</span> “To the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write: “He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one opens, says these things:  <span class="verse">8</span> “I know your works (behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one can shut), that you have a little power, and kept my word, and didn’t deny my name.  <span class="verse">9</span> Behold, I give some of the synagogue of Satan, of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but lie—behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.  <span class="verse">10</span> Because you kept my command to endure, I also will keep you from the hour of testing which is to come on the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.  <span class="verse">11</span> I am coming quickly! Hold firmly that which you have, so that no one takes your crown.  <span class="verse">12</span> He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will go out from there no more. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name.  <span class="verse">13</span> He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.
