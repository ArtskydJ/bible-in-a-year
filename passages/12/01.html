		<span class="reference">Hosea 1-3</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s  word that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.   <span class="verse">2</span> When Yahweh spoke at first by Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the land commits great adultery, forsaking Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">3</span> So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.  <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said to him, “Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease.   <span class="verse">5</span> It will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”  <span class="verse">6</span> She conceived again, and bore a daughter.  Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah ; for I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any way pardon them.   <span class="verse">7</span> But I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their God,  and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bore a son.  <span class="verse">9</span> He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi ; for you are not my people, and I will not be yours.   <span class="verse">10</span> Yet the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can’t be measured or counted; and it will come to pass that, in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’   <span class="verse">11</span> The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for great will be the day of Jezreel.   <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Say to your brothers, ‘My people!’ and to your sisters, ‘My loved one!’ <span class="verse">2</span> Contend with your mother!  Contend, for she is not my wife,  neither am I her husband;  and let her put away her prostitution from her face,  and her adulteries from between her breasts;  <span class="verse">3</span> Lest I strip her naked,  and make her bare as in the day that she was born,  and make her like a wilderness,  and set her like a dry land,  and kill her with thirst.  <span class="verse">4</span> Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy;  for they are children of unfaithfulness;  <span class="verse">5</span> For their mother has played the prostitute.  She who conceived them has done shamefully;  for she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,  who give me my bread and my water,  my wool and my flax,  my oil and my drink.’  <span class="verse">6</span> Therefore behold,  I will hedge up your way with thorns,  and I will build a wall against her,  that she can’t find her way.  <span class="verse">7</span> She will follow after her lovers,  but she won’t overtake them;  and she will seek them,  but won’t find them.  Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband;  for then was it better with me than now.’  <span class="verse">8</span> For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,  and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.  <span class="verse">9</span> Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,  and my new wine in its season,  and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.  <span class="verse">10</span> Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,  and no one will deliver her out of my hand.  <span class="verse">11</span> I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:  her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.  <span class="verse">12</span> I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,  about which she has said, ‘These are my wages that my lovers have given me;  and I will make them a forest,’  and the animals of the field shall eat them.  <span class="verse">13</span> I will visit on her the days of the Baals,  to which she burned incense,  when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,  and went after her lovers,  and forgot me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">14</span> “Therefore behold, I will allure her,  and bring her into the wilderness,  and speak tenderly to her.  <span class="verse">15</span> I will give her vineyards from there,  and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;  and she will respond there,  as in the days of her youth,  and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse">16</span> It will be in that day,” says Yahweh,  “that you will call me ‘my husband,’  and no longer call me ‘my master.’  <span class="verse">17</span> For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,  and they will no longer be mentioned by name.  <span class="verse">18</span> In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,  and with the birds of the sky,  and with the creeping things of the ground.  I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,  and will make them lie down safely.  <span class="verse">19</span> I will betroth you to me forever.  Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.  <span class="verse">20</span> I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;  and you shall know Yahweh.  <span class="verse">21</span> It will happen in that day, I will respond,” says Yahweh,  “I will respond to the heavens,  and they will respond to the earth;  <span class="verse">22</span> and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;  and they will respond to Jezreel.  <span class="verse">23</span> I will sow her to me in the earth;  and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;  and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my people;’  and they will say, ‘My God!’ ”   <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins.”  <span class="verse">2</span> So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer   and a half of barley.   <span class="verse">3</span> I said to her, “You shall stay with me many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with any other man. I will also be so toward you.”  <span class="verse">4</span> For the children of Israel shall live many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without sacred stone, and without ephod or idols.   <span class="verse">5</span> Afterward the children of Israel shall return, and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall come with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days.

His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.  <span class="verse">3</span> Oh that I knew where I might find him!  That I might come even to his seat!  <span class="verse">4</span> I would set my cause in order before him,  and fill my mouth with arguments.  <span class="verse">5</span> I would know the words which he would answer me,  and understand what he would tell me.  <span class="verse">6</span> Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?  No, but he would listen to me.  <span class="verse">7</span> There the upright might reason with him,  so I should be delivered forever from my judge.  <span class="verse">8</span> “If I go east, he is not there;  if west, I can’t find him;  <span class="verse">9</span> He works to the north, but I can’t see him.  He turns south, but I can’t catch a glimpse of him.  <span class="verse">10</span> But he knows the way that I take.  When he has tried me, I will come out like gold.  <span class="verse">11</span> My foot has held fast to his steps.  I have kept his way, and not turned away.  <span class="verse">12</span> I haven’t gone back from the commandment of his lips.  I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.  <span class="verse">13</span> But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?  What his soul desires, even that he does.  <span class="verse">14</span> For he performs that which is appointed for me.  Many such things are with him.  <span class="verse">15</span> Therefore I am terrified at his presence.  When I consider, I am afraid of him.  <span class="verse">16</span> For God has made my heart faint.  The Almighty has terrified me.  <span class="verse">17</span> Because I was not cut off before the darkness,  neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.

Believe also in me.  <span class="verse">2</span> In my Father’s house are many homes. If it weren’t so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.  <span class="verse">3</span> If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.  <span class="verse">4</span> You know where I go, and you know the way.” <span class="verse">5</span> Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going. How can we know the way?”  <span class="verse">6</span> Jesus said to him,  “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.  <span class="verse">7</span> If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him.” <span class="verse">8</span> Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Jesus said to him,  “Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father?’  <span class="verse">10</span> Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works.  <span class="verse">11</span> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works’ sake.  <span class="verse">12</span> Most certainly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.  <span class="verse">13</span> Whatever you will ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  <span class="verse">14</span> If you will ask anything in my name, I will do it.
