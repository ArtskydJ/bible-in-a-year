		<span class="reference">Amos 5</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.  <span class="verse">2</span> “The virgin of Israel has fallen;  She shall rise no more.  She is cast down on her land;  there is no one to raise her up.”  <span class="verse">3</span> For the Lord Yahweh says:  “The city that went out a thousand shall have a hundred left,  and that which went out one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.”  <span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh says to the house of Israel:  “Seek me, and you will live;  <span class="verse">5</span> but don’t seek Bethel,  nor enter into Gilgal,  and don’t pass to Beersheba:  for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,  and Bethel shall come to nothing.  <span class="verse">6</span> Seek Yahweh, and you will live;  lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,  and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel.  <span class="verse">7</span> You who turn justice to wormwood,  and cast down righteousness to the earth:  <span class="verse">8</span> seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion,  and turns the shadow of death into the morning,  and makes the day dark with night;  who calls for the waters of the sea,  and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh is his name,  <span class="verse">9</span> who brings sudden destruction on the strong,  so that destruction comes on the fortress.  <span class="verse">10</span> They hate him who reproves in the gate,  and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly.  <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore, because you trample on the poor,  and take taxes from him of wheat:  You have built houses of cut stone,  but you will not dwell in them.  You have planted pleasant vineyards,  but you shall not drink their wine.  <span class="verse">12</span> For I know how many your offenses,  and how great are your sins—  you who afflict the just,  who take a bribe,  and who turn away the needy in the courts.  <span class="verse">13</span> Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time,  for it is an evil time.  <span class="verse">14</span> Seek good, and not evil,  that you may live;  and so Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be with you,  as you say.  <span class="verse">15</span> Hate evil, love good,  and establish justice in the courts.  It may be that Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the Lord, says:  “Wailing will be in all the wide ways;  and they will say in all the streets, ‘Alas! Alas!’  and they will call the farmer to mourning,  and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing.  <span class="verse">17</span> In all vineyards there will be wailing;  for I will pass through the middle of you,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">18</span> “Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh!  Why do you long for the day of Yahweh?  It is darkness,  and not light.  <span class="verse">19</span> As if a man fled from a lion,  and a bear met him;  Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall,  and a snake bit him.  <span class="verse">20</span> Won’t the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light?  Even very dark, and no brightness in it?  <span class="verse">21</span> I hate, I despise your feasts,  and I can’t stand your solemn assemblies.  <span class="verse">22</span> Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings,  I will not accept them;  neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.  <span class="verse">23</span> Take away from me the noise of your songs!  I will not listen to the music of your harps.  <span class="verse">24</span> But let justice roll on like rivers,  and righteousness like a mighty stream.  <span class="verse">25</span> “Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel?   <span class="verse">26</span> You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.   <span class="verse">27</span> Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,” says Yahweh, whose name is the God of Armies.

Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.  <span class="verse">9</span> “If my heart has been enticed to a woman,  and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door,  <span class="verse">10</span> then let my wife grind for another,  and let others sleep with her.  <span class="verse">11</span> For that would be a heinous crime.  Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges;  <span class="verse">12</span> for it is a fire that consumes to destruction,  and would root out all my increase.  <span class="verse">13</span> “If I have despised the cause of my male servant  or of my female servant,  when they contended with me,  <span class="verse">14</span> what then will I do when God rises up?  When he visits, what will I answer him?  <span class="verse">15</span> Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him?  Didn’t one fashion us in the womb?  <span class="verse">16</span> “If I have withheld the poor from their desire,  or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,  <span class="verse">17</span> or have eaten my morsel alone,  and the fatherless has not eaten of it  <span class="verse">18</span> (no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,  I have guided her from my mother’s womb);  <span class="verse">19</span> if I have seen any perish for want of clothing,  or that the needy had no covering;  <span class="verse">20</span> if his heart hasn’t blessed me,  if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece;  <span class="verse">21</span> if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,  because I saw my help in the gate,  <span class="verse">22</span> then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade,  and my arm be broken from the bone.  <span class="verse">23</span> For calamity from God is a terror to me.  Because of his majesty, I can do nothing.

		<span class="reference">Revelation 8</span>  <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.   <span class="verse">2</span> I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.  <span class="verse">3</span> Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.   <span class="verse">4</span> The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand.   <span class="verse">5</span> The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, then threw it on the earth. Thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake followed.  <span class="verse">6</span> The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.   <span class="verse">7</span> The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burned up,   and one third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.  <span class="verse">8</span> The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,   <span class="verse">9</span> and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died. One third of the ships were destroyed.  <span class="verse">10</span> The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.   <span class="verse">11</span> The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter.  <span class="verse">12</span> The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn’t shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.   <span class="verse">13</span> I saw, and I heard an eagle,  flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!”
