Isn’t this true,  you children of Israel?” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">12</span> “But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink,  and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘Don’t prophesy!’  <span class="verse">13</span> Behold,  I will crush you in your place,  as a cart crushes that is full of grain.  <span class="verse">14</span> Flight will perish from the swift;  and the strong won’t strengthen his force;  neither shall the mighty deliver himself;  <span class="verse">15</span> neither shall he stand who handles the bow;  and he who is swift of foot won’t escape;  neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself;  <span class="verse">16</span> and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day,”  says Yahweh.

They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.  <span class="verse">4</span> They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.  The roots of the broom tree are their food.  <span class="verse">5</span> They are driven out from among men.  They cry after them as after a thief;  <span class="verse">6</span> So that they dwell in frightful valleys,  and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.  <span class="verse">7</span> They bray among the bushes.  They are gathered together under the nettles .  <span class="verse">8</span> They are children of fools, yes, children of wicked men.  They were flogged out of the land.  <span class="verse">9</span> “Now I have become their song.  Yes, I am a byword to them.  <span class="verse">10</span> They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,  and don’t hesitate to spit in my face.  <span class="verse">11</span> For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me;  and they have thrown off restraint before me.  <span class="verse">12</span> On my right hand rise the rabble.  They thrust aside my feet,  They cast up against me their ways of destruction.  <span class="verse">13</span> They mar my path.  They promote my destruction  without anyone’s help.  <span class="verse">14</span> As through a wide breach they come.  They roll themselves in amid the ruin.  <span class="verse">15</span> Terrors have turned on me.  They chase my honor as the wind.  My welfare has passed away as a cloud.

You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy.  <span class="verse">21</span> A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her time has come. But when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world.  <span class="verse">22</span> Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you. <span class="verse">23</span> “In that day you will ask me no questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you.  <span class="verse">24</span> Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.

A crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer.  <span class="verse">3</span> When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!”   <span class="verse">4</span> Another came out: a red horse. To him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword.  <span class="verse">5</span> When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come and see!” And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.   <span class="verse">6</span> I heard a voice in the middle of the four living creatures saying, “A choenix   of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don’t damage the oil and the wine!”  <span class="verse">7</span> When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature saying, “Come and see!”   <span class="verse">8</span> And behold, a pale horse, and the name of he who sat on it was Death. Hades   followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to him.  <span class="verse">9</span> When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had.   <span class="verse">10</span> They cried with a loud voice, saying, “How long, Master, the holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?”   <span class="verse">11</span> A long white robe was given to each of them. They were told that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants and their brothers,   who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their course.  <span class="verse">12</span> I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.   <span class="verse">13</span> The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.   <span class="verse">14</span> The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.   <span class="verse">15</span> The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.   <span class="verse">16</span> They told the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,   <span class="verse">17</span> for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?”
