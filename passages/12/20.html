		<span class="reference">Habakkuk 1-3</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> The revelation which Habakkuk the prophet saw.   <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh,  how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you “Violence!” and will you not save?   <span class="verse">3</span> Why do you show me iniquity, and look at perversity? For destruction and violence are before me. There is strife, and contention rises up.   <span class="verse">4</span> Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice never prevails; for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice comes out perverted.  <span class="verse">5</span> “Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you.   <span class="verse">6</span> For, behold,  I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the width of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.   <span class="verse">7</span> They are feared and dreaded. Their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.   <span class="verse">8</span> Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen press proudly on. Yes, their horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle that hurries to devour.   <span class="verse">9</span> All of them come for violence. Their hordes face the desert. He gathers prisoners like sand.   <span class="verse">10</span> Yes, he scoffs at kings, and princes are a derision to him. He laughs at every stronghold, for he builds up an earthen ramp, and takes it.   <span class="verse">11</span> Then he sweeps by like the wind, and goes on. He is indeed guilty, whose strength is his god.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Aren’t you from everlasting, Yahweh my God,  my Holy One? We will not die. Yahweh, you have appointed him for judgment. You, Rock, have established him to punish.   <span class="verse">13</span> You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he,   <span class="verse">14</span> and make men like the fish of the sea, like the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?   <span class="verse">15</span> He takes up all of them with the hook. He catches them in his net, and gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he rejoices and is glad.   <span class="verse">16</span> Therefore he sacrifices to his net, and burns incense to his dragnet, because by them his life is luxurious, and his food is good.   <span class="verse">17</span> Will he therefore continually empty his net, and kill the nations without mercy?   <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> I will stand at my watch, and set myself on the ramparts, and will look out to see what he will say to me, and what I will answer concerning my complaint.  <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh answered me, “Write the vision, and make it plain on tablets, that he who runs may read it.   <span class="verse">3</span> For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it hurries toward the end, and won’t prove false. Though it takes time, wait for it; because it will surely come. It won’t delay.   <span class="verse">4</span> Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is not upright in him, but the righteous will live by his faith.   <span class="verse">5</span> Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous. An arrogant man who doesn’t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as Sheol,  and he is like death, and can’t be satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations, and heaps to himself all peoples.   <span class="verse">6</span> Won’t all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, ‘Woe to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches himself by extortion! How long?’   <span class="verse">7</span> Won’t your debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and you will be their victim?   <span class="verse">8</span> Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.   <span class="verse">9</span> Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!   <span class="verse">10</span> You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.   <span class="verse">11</span> For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the woodwork will answer it.   <span class="verse">12</span> Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!   <span class="verse">13</span> Behold, isn’t it of Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?   <span class="verse">14</span> For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of Yahweh’s glory, as the waters cover the sea.  <span class="verse">15</span> “Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink, pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze at their naked bodies!   <span class="verse">16</span> You are filled with shame, and not glory. You will also drink, and be exposed! The cup of Yahweh’s right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover your glory.   <span class="verse">17</span> For the violence done to Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals, which made them afraid; because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to every city and to those who dwell in them.  <span class="verse">18</span> “What value does the engraved image have, that its maker has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?   <span class="verse">19</span> Woe to him who says to the wood, ‘Awake!’ or to the mute stone, ‘Arise!’ Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all within it.   <span class="verse">20</span> But Yahweh is in his holy temple. Let all the earth be silent before him!”   <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> A prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet, set to victorious music.  <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh, I have heard of your fame.  I stand in awe of your deeds, Yahweh.  Renew your work in the middle of the years.  In the middle of the years make it known.  In wrath, you remember mercy.  <span class="verse">3</span> God came from Teman,  the Holy One from Mount Paran.  His glory covered the heavens,  and his praise filled the earth.  <span class="verse">4</span> His splendor is like the sunrise.  Rays shine from his hand, where his power is hidden.  <span class="verse">5</span> Plague went before him,  and pestilence followed his feet.  <span class="verse">6</span> He stood, and shook the earth.  He looked, and made the nations tremble.  The ancient mountains were crumbled.  The age-old hills collapsed.  His ways are eternal.  <span class="verse">7</span> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction.  The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled.  <span class="verse">8</span> Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers?  Was your anger against the rivers,  or your wrath against the sea,  that you rode on your horses,  on your chariots of salvation?  <span class="verse">9</span> You uncovered your bow.  You called for your sworn arrows.  You split the earth with rivers.  <span class="verse">10</span> The mountains saw you, and were afraid.  The storm of waters passed by.  The deep roared and lifted up its hands on high.  <span class="verse">11</span> The sun and moon stood still in the sky,  at the light of your arrows as they went,  at the shining of your glittering spear.  <span class="verse">12</span> You marched through the land in wrath.  You threshed the nations in anger.  <span class="verse">13</span> You went out for the salvation of your people,  for the salvation of your anointed.  You crushed the head of the land of wickedness.  You stripped them head to foot.  <span class="verse">14</span> You pierced the heads of his warriors with their own spears.  They came as a whirlwind to scatter me,  gloating as if to devour the wretched in secret.  <span class="verse">15</span> You trampled the sea with your horses,  churning mighty waters.  <span class="verse">16</span> I heard, and my body trembled.  My lips quivered at the voice.  Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place,  because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,  for the coming up of the people who invade us.  <span class="verse">17</span> For though the fig tree doesn’t flourish,  nor fruit be in the vines;  the labor of the olive fails,  the fields yield no food;  the flocks are cut off from the fold,  and there is no herd in the stalls:  <span class="verse">18</span> yet I will rejoice in Yahweh.  I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!  <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh, the Lord,  is my strength.  He makes my feet like deer’s feet,  and enables me to go in high places.  For the music director, on my stringed instruments.

That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.  <span class="verse">17</span> “But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.  Judgment and justice take hold of you.  <span class="verse">18</span> Don’t let riches entice you to wrath,  neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.  <span class="verse">19</span> Would your wealth sustain you in distress,  or all the might of your strength?  <span class="verse">20</span> Don’t desire the night,  when people are cut off in their place.  <span class="verse">21</span> Take heed, don’t regard iniquity;  for you have chosen this rather than affliction.  <span class="verse">22</span> Behold, God is exalted in his power.  Who is a teacher like him?  <span class="verse">23</span> Who has prescribed his way for him?  Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’  <span class="verse">24</span> “Remember that you magnify his work,  about which men have sung.  <span class="verse">25</span> All men have looked on it.  Man sees it afar off.  <span class="verse">26</span> Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him.  The number of his years is unsearchable.  <span class="verse">27</span> For he draws up the drops of water,  which distill in rain from his vapor,  <span class="verse">28</span> which the skies pour down  and which drop on man abundantly.  <span class="verse">29</span> Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds,  and the thunderings of his pavilion?  <span class="verse">30</span> Behold, he spreads his light around him.  He covers the bottom of the sea.  <span class="verse">31</span> For by these he judges the people.  He gives food in abundance.  <span class="verse">32</span> He covers his hands with the lightning,  and commands it to strike the mark.  <span class="verse">33</span> Its noise tells about him,  and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up.

Don’t you know that I have power to release you and have power to crucify you?”  <span class="verse">11</span> Jesus answered,  “You would have no power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above. Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.” <span class="verse">12</span> At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man, you aren’t Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!”  <span class="verse">13</span> When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called “The Pavement”, but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”   <span class="verse">14</span> Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover, at about the sixth hour.  He said to the Jews, “Behold, your King!”  <span class="verse">15</span> They cried out, “Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!”  Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”  The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”  <span class="verse">16</span> So then he delivered him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away.

He also had a sharp sickle.   <span class="verse">18</span> Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Send your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth’s grapes are fully ripe!”   <span class="verse">19</span> The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of God.   <span class="verse">20</span> The wine press was trodden outside of the city, and blood came out of the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.
