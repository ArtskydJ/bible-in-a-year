		<span class="reference">Joel 3</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> “For, behold, in those days,  and in that time,  when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,  <span class="verse">2</span> I will gather all nations,  and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;  and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,  and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations.  They have divided my land,  <span class="verse">3</span> and have cast lots for my people,  and have given a boy for a prostitute,  and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,  and all the regions of Philistia?  Will you repay me?  And if you repay me,  I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.  <span class="verse">5</span> Because you have taken my silver and my gold,  and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,  <span class="verse">6</span> and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,  that you may remove them far from their border.  <span class="verse">7</span> Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,  and will return your repayment on your own head;  <span class="verse">8</span> and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,  and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,  to a faraway nation,  for Yahweh has spoken it.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Proclaim this among the nations:  “Prepare for war!  Stir up the mighty men.  Let all the warriors draw near.  Let them come up.   <span class="verse">10</span> Beat your plowshares into swords,  and your pruning hooks into spears.  Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’  <span class="verse">11</span> Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,  and gather yourselves together.”  Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.  <span class="verse">12</span> “Let the nations arouse themselves,  and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;  for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.  <span class="verse">13</span> Put in the sickle;  for the harvest is ripe.  Come, tread, for the wine press is full,  the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.”  <span class="verse">14</span> Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!  For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.  <span class="verse">15</span> The sun and the moon are darkened,  and the stars withdraw their shining.  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh will roar from Zion,  and thunder from Jerusalem;  and the heavens and the earth will shake;  but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,  and a stronghold to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse">17</span> “So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,  dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.  Then Jerusalem will be holy,  and no strangers will pass through her any more.  <span class="verse">18</span> It will happen in that day,  that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,  the hills will flow with milk,  all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters,  and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh’s house,  and will water the valley of Shittim.  <span class="verse">19</span> Egypt will be a desolation,  and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,  for the violence done to the children of Judah,  because they have shed innocent blood in their land.  <span class="verse">20</span> But Judah will be inhabited forever,  and Jerusalem from generation to generation.  <span class="verse">21</span> I will cleanse their blood,  that I have not cleansed:  for Yahweh dwells in Zion.”

The aged rose up and stood.  <span class="verse">9</span> The princes refrained from talking,  and laid their hand on their mouth.  <span class="verse">10</span> The voice of the nobles was hushed,  and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.  <span class="verse">11</span> For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;  and when the eye saw me, it commended me:  <span class="verse">12</span> Because I delivered the poor who cried,  and the fatherless also, who had no one to help him,  <span class="verse">13</span> the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me,  and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.  <span class="verse">14</span> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me.  My justice was as a robe and a diadem.  <span class="verse">15</span> I was eyes to the blind,  and feet to the lame.  <span class="verse">16</span> I was a father to the needy.  I researched the cause of him who I didn’t know.  <span class="verse">17</span> I broke the jaws of the unrighteous  and plucked the prey out of his teeth.  <span class="verse">18</span> Then I said, ‘I will die in my own house,  I will count my days as the sand.  <span class="verse">19</span> My root is spread out to the waters.  The dew lies all night on my branch.  <span class="verse">20</span> My glory is fresh in me.  My bow is renewed in my hand.’  <span class="verse">21</span> “Men listened to me, waited,  and kept silence for my counsel.  <span class="verse">22</span> After my words they didn’t speak again.  My speech fell on them.  <span class="verse">23</span> They waited for me as for the rain.  Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.  <span class="verse">24</span> I smiled on them when they had no confidence.  They didn’t reject the light of my face.  <span class="verse">25</span> I chose out their way, and sat as chief.  I lived as a king in the army,  as one who comforts the mourners.

He will declare to you things that are coming.  <span class="verse">14</span> He will glorify me, for he will take from what is mine, and will declare it to you.  <span class="verse">15</span> All things that the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he takes of mine and will declare it to you.  <span class="verse">16</span> A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.” <span class="verse">17</span> Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, “What is this that he says to us,  ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’  and,  ‘Because I go to the Father’ ?”   <span class="verse">18</span> They said therefore, “What is this that he says,  ‘A little while’ ? We don’t know what he is saying.”

		<span class="reference">Revelation 5</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.   <span class="verse">2</span> I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?”   <span class="verse">3</span> No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book or to look in it.   <span class="verse">4</span> Then I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look in it.   <span class="verse">5</span> One of the elders said to me, “Don’t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome: he who opens the book and its seven seals.”   <span class="verse">6</span> I saw in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.   <span class="verse">7</span> Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.   <span class="verse">8</span> Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.   <span class="verse">9</span> They sang a new song, saying,  “You are worthy to take the book  and to open its seals:  for you were killed,  and bought us for God with your blood  out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,  <span class="verse">10</span> and made us kings and priests to our God,  and we will reign on the earth.”  <span class="verse">11</span> I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. The number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;   <span class="verse">12</span> saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!”  <span class="verse">13</span> I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, “To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!” <span class="verse">14</span> The four living creatures said, “Amen!” Then the  elders fell down and worshiped.
