		<span class="reference">Hosea 4-6</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> Hear Yahweh’s word, you children of Israel;  for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:  “Indeed there is no truth,  nor goodness,  nor knowledge of God in the land.  <span class="verse">2</span> There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;  they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.  <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore the land will mourn,  and everyone who dwells in it will waste away,  with all living things in her,  even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky,  yes, the fish of the sea also die.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.  <span class="verse">5</span> You will stumble in the day,  and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;  and I will destroy your mother.  <span class="verse">6</span> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.  Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,  that you may be no priest to me.  Because you have forgotten your God’s law,  I will also forget your children.  <span class="verse">7</span> As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.  I will change their glory into shame.  <span class="verse">8</span> They feed on the sin of my people,  and set their heart on their iniquity.  <span class="verse">9</span> It will be, like people, like priest;  and I will punish them for their ways,  and will repay them for their deeds.  <span class="verse">10</span> They will eat, and not have enough.  They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;  because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh.  <span class="verse">11</span> Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.  <span class="verse">12</span> My people consult with their wooden idol,  and answer to a stick of wood.  Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,  and they have been unfaithful to their God.  <span class="verse">13</span> They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,  and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,  because its shade is good.  Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,  and your brides commit adultery.  <span class="verse">14</span> I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,  nor your brides when they commit adultery;  because the men consort with prostitutes,  and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;  so the people without understanding will come to ruin.  <span class="verse">15</span> “Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,  yet don’t let Judah offend;  and don’t come to Gilgal,  neither go up to Beth Aven,  nor swear, ‘As Yahweh lives.’  <span class="verse">16</span> For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.  Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow.  <span class="verse">17</span> Ephraim is joined to idols.  Leave him alone!  <span class="verse">18</span> Their drink has become sour.  They play the prostitute continually.  Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.  <span class="verse">19</span> The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;  and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.   <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Listen to this, you priests!  Listen, house of Israel,  and give ear, house of the king!  For the judgment is against you;  for you have been a snare at Mizpah,  and a net spread on Tabor.  <span class="verse">2</span> The rebels are deep in slaughter;  but I discipline all of them.  <span class="verse">3</span> I know Ephraim,  and Israel is not hidden from me;  for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.  Israel is defiled.  <span class="verse">4</span> Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their God;  for the spirit of prostitution is within them,  and they don’t know Yahweh.  <span class="verse">5</span> The pride of Israel testifies to his face.  Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.  Judah also will stumble with them.  <span class="verse">6</span> They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh;  but they won’t find him.  He has withdrawn himself from them.  <span class="verse">7</span> They are unfaithful to Yahweh;  for they have borne illegitimate children.  Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.  <span class="verse">8</span> “Blow the cornet in Gibeah,  and the trumpet in Ramah!  Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!  <span class="verse">9</span> Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.  Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be.  <span class="verse">10</span> The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark.  I will pour out my wrath on them like water.  <span class="verse">11</span> Ephraim is oppressed,  he is crushed in judgment;  Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.  <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth,  and to the house of Judah like rottenness.  <span class="verse">13</span> “When Ephraim saw his sickness,  and Judah his wound,  Then Ephraim went to Assyria,  and sent to king Jareb:  but he is not able to heal you,  neither will he cure you of your wound.  <span class="verse">14</span> For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,  and like a young lion to the house of Judah.  I myself will tear in pieces and go away.  I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.  <span class="verse">15</span> I will go and return to my place,  until they acknowledge their offense,  and seek my face.  In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”   <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Come! Let’s return to Yahweh;  for he has torn us to pieces,  and he will heal us;  he has injured us,  and he will bind up our wounds.  <span class="verse">2</span> After two days he will revive us.  On the third day he will raise us up,  and we will live before him.  <span class="verse">3</span> Let’s acknowledge Yahweh.  Let’s press on to know Yahweh.  As surely as the sun rises,  Yahweh will appear.  He will come to us like the rain,  like the spring rain that waters the earth.”  <span class="verse">4</span> “Ephraim, what shall I do to you?  Judah, what shall I do to you?  For your love is like a morning cloud,  and like the dew that disappears early.  <span class="verse">5</span> Therefore I have cut them to pieces with the prophets;  I killed them with the words of my mouth.  Your judgments are like a flash of lightning.  <span class="verse">6</span> For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice;  and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.  <span class="verse">7</span> But they, like Adam, have broken the covenant.  They were unfaithful to me, there.  <span class="verse">8</span> Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity;  it is stained with blood.  <span class="verse">9</span> As gangs of robbers wait to ambush a man,  so the company of priests murder on the path toward Shechem,  committing shameful crimes.  <span class="verse">10</span> In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing.  There is prostitution in Ephraim.  Israel is defiled.  <span class="verse">11</span> “Also, Judah, there is a harvest appointed for you,  when I restore the fortunes of my people.

Why don’t those who know him see his days?  <span class="verse">2</span> There are people who remove the landmarks.  They violently take away flocks, and feed them.  <span class="verse">3</span> They drive away the donkey of the fatherless,  and they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.  <span class="verse">4</span> They turn the needy out of the way.  The poor of the earth all hide themselves.  <span class="verse">5</span> Behold, as wild donkeys in the desert,  they go out to their work, seeking diligently for food.  The wilderness yields them bread for their children.  <span class="verse">6</span> They cut their food in the field.  They glean the vineyard of the wicked.  <span class="verse">7</span> They lie all night naked without clothing,  and have no covering in the cold.  <span class="verse">8</span> They are wet with the showers of the mountains,  and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter.  <span class="verse">9</span> There are those who pluck the fatherless from the breast,  and take a pledge of the poor,  <span class="verse">10</span> So that they go around naked without clothing.  Being hungry, they carry the sheaves.  <span class="verse">11</span> They make oil within the walls of these men.  They tread wine presses, and suffer thirst.  <span class="verse">12</span> From out of the populous city, men groan.  The soul of the wounded cries out,  yet God doesn’t regard the folly.

You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.  <span class="verse">18</span> I will not leave you orphans.

Having turned, I saw seven golden lamp stands.   <span class="verse">13</span> And among the lamp stands was one like a son of man,  clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.   <span class="verse">14</span> His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.   <span class="verse">15</span> His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.   <span class="verse">16</span> He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.   <span class="verse">17</span> When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.  He laid his right hand on me, saying,  “Don’t be afraid. I am the first and the last,  <span class="verse">18</span> and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever and ever. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades. <span class="verse">19</span> Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter.  <span class="verse">20</span> The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp stands is this: The seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies. The seven lamp stands are seven assemblies.
