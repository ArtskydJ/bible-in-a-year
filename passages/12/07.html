		<span class="reference">Joel 2</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Blow the trumpet in Zion,  and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!  Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,  for the day of Yahweh comes,  for it is close at hand:  <span class="verse">2</span> A day of darkness and gloominess,  a day of clouds and thick darkness.  As the dawn spreading on the mountains,  a great and strong people;  there has never been the like,  neither will there be any more after them,  even to the years of many generations.  <span class="verse">3</span> A fire devours before them,  and behind them, a flame burns.  The land is as the garden of Eden before them,  and behind them, a desolate wilderness.  Yes, and no one has escaped them.  <span class="verse">4</span> Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,  and they run as horsemen.  <span class="verse">5</span> Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap,  like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,  like a strong people set in battle array.  <span class="verse">6</span> At their presence the peoples are in anguish.  All faces have grown pale.  <span class="verse">7</span> They run like mighty men.  They climb the wall like warriors.  They each march in his line, and they don’t swerve off course.  <span class="verse">8</span> Neither does one jostle another;  they march everyone in his path,  and they burst through the defenses,  and don’t break ranks.  <span class="verse">9</span> They rush on the city.  They run on the wall.  They climb up into the houses.  They enter in at the windows like thieves.  <span class="verse">10</span> The earth quakes before them.  The heavens tremble.  The sun and the moon are darkened,  and the stars withdraw their shining.  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh thunders his voice before his army;  for his forces are very great;  for he is strong who obeys his command;  for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,  and who can endure it?  <span class="verse">12</span> “Yet even now,” says Yahweh, “turn to me with all your heart,  and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Tear your heart, and not your garments,  and turn to Yahweh, your God;  for he is gracious and merciful,  slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,  and relents from sending calamity.  <span class="verse">14</span> Who knows? He may turn and relent,  and leave a blessing behind him,  even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.  <span class="verse">15</span> Blow the trumpet in Zion!  Sanctify a fast.  Call a solemn assembly.  <span class="verse">16</span> Gather the people.  Sanctify the assembly.  Assemble the elders.  Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.  Let the bridegroom go out of his room,  and the bride out of her room.  <span class="verse">17</span> Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar,  and let them say, “Spare your people, Yahweh,  and don’t give your heritage to reproach,  that the nations should rule over them.  Why should they say among the peoples,  ‘Where is their God?’ ”  <span class="verse">18</span> Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,  And had pity on his people.  <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh answered his people,  “Behold,  I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,  and you will be satisfied with them;  and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.  <span class="verse">20</span> But I will remove the northern army far away from you,  and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,  its front into the eastern sea,  and its back into the western sea;  and its stench will come up,  and its bad smell will rise.”  Surely he has done great things.  <span class="verse">21</span> Land, don’t be afraid.  Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.  <span class="verse">22</span> Don’t be afraid, you animals of the field;  for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,  for the tree bears its fruit.  The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.  <span class="verse">23</span> “Be glad then, you children of Zion,  and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;  for he gives you the early rain in just measure,  and he causes the rain to come down for you,  the early rain and the latter rain,  as before.  <span class="verse">24</span> The threshing floors will be full of wheat,  and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.  <span class="verse">25</span> I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,  the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,  my great army, which I sent among you.  <span class="verse">26</span> You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied,  and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,  who has dealt wondrously with you;  and my people will never again be disappointed.  <span class="verse">27</span> You will know that I am among Israel,  and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else;  and my people will never again be disappointed.  <span class="verse">28</span> “It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;  and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.  Your old men will dream dreams.  Your young men will see visions.  <span class="verse">29</span> And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,  I will pour out my Spirit.  <span class="verse">30</span> I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:  blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.  <span class="verse">31</span> The sun will be turned into darkness,  and the moon into blood,  before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.  <span class="verse">32</span> It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh’s name shall be saved;  for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,  as Yahweh has said,  and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.

Where is the place of understanding?  <span class="verse">13</span> Man doesn’t know its price;  Neither is it found in the land of the living.  <span class="verse">14</span> The deep says, ‘It isn’t in me.’  The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’  <span class="verse">15</span> It can’t be gotten for gold,  neither will silver be weighed for its price.  <span class="verse">16</span> It can’t be valued with the gold of Ophir,  with the precious onyx, or the sapphire. <span class="verse">17</span> Gold and glass can’t equal it,  neither will it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.  <span class="verse">18</span> No mention will be made of coral or of crystal.  Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.  <span class="verse">19</span> The topaz of Ethiopia will not equal it,  nor will it be valued with pure gold.  <span class="verse">20</span> Where then does wisdom come from?  Where is the place of understanding?  <span class="verse">21</span> Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living,  and kept close from the birds of the sky.  <span class="verse">22</span> Destruction and Death say,  ‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’  <span class="verse">23</span> “God understands its way,  and he knows its place.  <span class="verse">24</span> For he looks to the ends of the earth,  and sees under the whole sky.  <span class="verse">25</span> He establishes the force of the wind.  Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.  <span class="verse">26</span> When he made a decree for the rain,  and a way for the lightning of the thunder,  <span class="verse">27</span> then he saw it, and declared it.  He established it, yes, and searched it out.  <span class="verse">28</span> To man he said,  ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord,  that is wisdom.  To depart from evil is understanding.’ ”

Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.  <span class="verse">3</span> They will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.  <span class="verse">4</span> But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them.

		<span class="reference">Revelation 4</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, “Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this.”  <span class="verse">2</span> Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne   <span class="verse">3</span> that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.   <span class="verse">4</span> Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.   <span class="verse">5</span> Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.   <span class="verse">6</span> Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.   <span class="verse">7</span> The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.   <span class="verse">8</span> The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, “Holy, holy, holy  is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!”  <span class="verse">9</span> When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,   <span class="verse">10</span> the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,   <span class="verse">11</span> “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,  to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created!”
