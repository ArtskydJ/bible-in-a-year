		<span class="reference">Zechariah 4-6</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep.   <span class="verse">2</span> He said to me, “What do you see?”  I said, “I have seen, and behold, a lamp stand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it;   <span class="verse">3</span> and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.”  <span class="verse">4</span> I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, “What are these, my lord?”  <span class="verse">5</span> Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?”  I said, “No, my lord.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, “This is Yahweh’s word to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">7</span> Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of ‘Grace, grace, to it!’ ”  <span class="verse">8</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">9</span> “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.   <span class="verse">10</span> Indeed, who despises the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are Yahweh’s eyes, which run back and forth through the whole earth.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lamp stand and on the left side of it?”  <span class="verse">12</span> I asked him the second time, “What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that pour the golden oil out of themselves?”  <span class="verse">13</span> He answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?”  I said, “No, my lord.”  <span class="verse">14</span> Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord   of the whole earth.”   <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a flying scroll.   <span class="verse">2</span> He said to me, “What do you see?”  I answered, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits,  and its width ten cubits.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land; for everyone who steals shall be cut off according to it on the one side; and everyone who swears falsely shall be cut off according to it on the other side.   <span class="verse">4</span> I will cause it to go out,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears falsely by my name; and it will remain in the middle of his house, and will destroy it with its timber and its stones.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Then the angel who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Lift up now your eyes, and see what this is that is appearing.”  <span class="verse">6</span> I said, “What is it?”  He said, “This is the ephah  basket that is appearing.” He said moreover, “This is their appearance in all the land   <span class="verse">7</span> (and behold, a talent  of lead was lifted up); and this is a woman sitting in the middle of the ephah  basket.”   <span class="verse">8</span> He said, “This is Wickedness;” and he threw her down into the middle of the ephah basket; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth.  <span class="verse">9</span> Then I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold, there were two women, and the wind was in their wings. Now they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah basket between earth and the sky.   <span class="verse">10</span> Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are these carrying the ephah basket?”  <span class="verse">11</span> He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.”   <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Again I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of bronze.   <span class="verse">2</span> In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot black horses;   <span class="verse">3</span> in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot dappled horses, all of them powerful.   <span class="verse">4</span> Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”  <span class="verse">5</span> The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth.   <span class="verse">6</span> The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out toward the south country.”   <span class="verse">7</span> The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said, “Go around and through the earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth.  <span class="verse">8</span> Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">10</span> “Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.   <span class="verse">11</span> Yes, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;   <span class="verse">12</span> and speak to him, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build Yahweh’s temple;   <span class="verse">13</span> even he shall build Yahweh’s temple; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.   <span class="verse">14</span> The crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in Yahweh’s temple.   <span class="verse">15</span> Those who are far off shall come and build in Yahweh’s temple; and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you. This will happen, if you will diligently obey Yahweh your God’s voice.” ’ ”

So as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,   <span class="verse">12</span> and she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.   <span class="verse">13</span> They asked her, “Woman, why are you weeping?”  She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have laid him.”   <span class="verse">14</span> When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t know that it was Jesus.  <span class="verse">15</span> Jesus said to her,  “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Jesus said to her,  “Mary.” She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!”  which is to say, “Teacher!” <span class="verse">17</span> Jesus said to her,  “Don’t hold me, for I haven’t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ ” <span class="verse">18</span> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things to her.

For your judgment has come in one hour.’   <span class="verse">11</span> The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise any more:   <span class="verse">12</span> merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;   <span class="verse">13</span> and cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and people’s bodies and souls.   <span class="verse">14</span> The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you. All things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you will find them no more at all.   <span class="verse">15</span> The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,   <span class="verse">16</span> saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!   <span class="verse">17</span> For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.’ Every ship master, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,   <span class="verse">18</span> and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What is like the great city?’   <span class="verse">19</span> They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!’ For she is made desolate in one hour.  <span class="verse">20</span> “Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her.”   <span class="verse">21</span> A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all.   <span class="verse">22</span> The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. No craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you.   <span class="verse">23</span> The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived.   <span class="verse">24</span> In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth.”
