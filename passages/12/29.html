		<span class="reference">Zechariah 13-14</span>  <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> “In that day there will be a spring opened to David’s house and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.   <span class="verse">2</span> It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they will be remembered no more. I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land.   <span class="verse">3</span> It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, ‘You must die, because you speak lies in Yahweh’s name;’ and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies.   <span class="verse">4</span> It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:   <span class="verse">5</span> but he will say, ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.’   <span class="verse">6</span> One will say to him, ‘What are these wounds between your arms?’ Then he will answer, ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’  <span class="verse">7</span> “Awake, sword, against my shepherd,  and against the man who is close to me,” says Yahweh of Armies.  “Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;  and I will turn my hand against the little ones.  <span class="verse">8</span> It shall happen that in all the land,” says Yahweh,  “two parts in it will be cut off and die;  but the third will be left in it.  <span class="verse">9</span> I will bring the third part into the fire,  and will refine them as silver is refined,  and will test them like gold is tested.  They will call on my name, and I will hear them.  I will say, ‘It is my people;’  and they will say, ‘Yahweh is my God.’ ”   <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, a day of Yahweh comes, when your plunder will be divided within you.   <span class="verse">2</span> For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city will be taken, the houses rifled, and the women ravished. Half of the city will go out into captivity, and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city.   <span class="verse">3</span> Then Yahweh will go out and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.   <span class="verse">4</span> His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives will be split in two, from east to west, making a very great valley. Half of the mountain will move toward the north, and half of it toward the south.   <span class="verse">5</span> You shall flee by the valley of my mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azel; yes, you shall flee, just like you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Yahweh my God will come, and all the holy ones with you. <span class="verse">6</span> It will happen in that day, that there will not be light, cold, or frost.   <span class="verse">7</span> It will be a unique day which is known to Yahweh; not day, and not night; but it will come to pass, that at evening time there will be light.  <span class="verse">8</span> It will happen in that day, that living waters will go out from Jerusalem: half of them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea. It will be so in summer and in winter.  <span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh will be King over all the earth. In that day Yahweh will be one, and his name one.   <span class="verse">10</span> All the land will be made like the Arabah, from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she will be lifted up, and will dwell in her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananel to the king’s wine presses.   <span class="verse">11</span> Men will dwell therein, and there will be no more curse; but Jerusalem will dwell safely.   <span class="verse">12</span> This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the peoples who have fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes will consume away in their sockets, and their tongue will consume away in their mouth.   <span class="verse">13</span> It will happen in that day, that a great panic from Yahweh will be among them; and they will each hold onto the hand of his neighbor, and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor.   <span class="verse">14</span> Judah also will fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together: gold, and silver, and clothing, in great abundance.  <span class="verse">15</span> A plague like this will fall on the horse, on the mule, on the camel, on the donkey, and on all the animals that will be in those camps.   <span class="verse">16</span> It will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, and to keep the feast of booths.   <span class="verse">17</span> It will be, that whoever of all the families of the earth doesn’t go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh of Armies, on them there will be no rain.   <span class="verse">18</span> If the family of Egypt doesn’t go up, and doesn’t come, neither will it rain on them. This will be the plague with which Yahweh will strike the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of booths.   <span class="verse">19</span> This will be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all the nations that don’t go up to keep the feast of booths.   <span class="verse">20</span> In that day there will be on the bells of the horses, “HOLY TO YAHWEH”; and the pots in Yahweh’s house will be like the bowls before the altar.   <span class="verse">21</span> Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to Yahweh of Armies; and all those who sacrifice will come and take of them, and cook in them. In that day there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of Yahweh of Armies.

		<span class="reference">Job 41:12-34</span>  <span class="chapter">41</span><span class="verse">12</span> “I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,  nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.  <span class="verse">13</span> Who can strip off his outer garment?  Who will come within his jaws?  <span class="verse">14</span> Who can open the doors of his face?  Around his teeth is terror.  <span class="verse">15</span> Strong scales are his pride,  shut up together with a close seal.  <span class="verse">16</span> One is so near to another,  that no air can come between them.  <span class="verse">17</span> They are joined to one another.  They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart.  <span class="verse">18</span> His sneezing flashes out light.  His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.  <span class="verse">19</span> Out of his mouth go burning torches.  Sparks of fire leap out.  <span class="verse">20</span> Out of his nostrils a smoke goes,  as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.  <span class="verse">21</span> His breath kindles coals.  A flame goes out of his mouth.  <span class="verse">22</span> There is strength in his neck.  Terror dances before him.  <span class="verse">23</span> The flakes of his flesh are joined together.  They are firm on him.  They can’t be moved.  <span class="verse">24</span> His heart is as firm as a stone,  yes, firm as the lower millstone.  <span class="verse">25</span> When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid.  They retreat before his thrashing.  <span class="verse">26</span> If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail;  nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.  <span class="verse">27</span> He counts iron as straw;  and bronze as rotten wood.  <span class="verse">28</span> The arrow can’t make him flee.  Sling stones are like chaff to him.  <span class="verse">29</span> Clubs are counted as stubble.  He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.  <span class="verse">30</span> His undersides are like sharp potsherds,  leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.  <span class="verse">31</span> He makes the deep to boil like a pot.  He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.  <span class="verse">32</span> He makes a path shine after him.  One would think the deep had white hair.  <span class="verse">33</span> On earth there is not his equal,  that is made without fear.  <span class="verse">34</span> He sees everything that is high.  He is king over all the sons of pride.”

Even though there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.  <span class="verse">12</span> Jesus said to them,  “Come and eat breakfast!” None of the disciples dared inquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing that it was the Lord.  <span class="verse">13</span> Then Jesus came and took the bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise.   <span class="verse">14</span> This is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples after he had risen from the dead.

Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more. The first things have passed away.”  <span class="verse">5</span> He who sits on the throne said,  “Behold, I am making all things new.”  He said,  “Write, for these words of God are faithful and true.”  <span class="verse">6</span> He said to me,  “I have become the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life.  <span class="verse">7</span> He who overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.  <span class="verse">8</span> But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.” <span class="verse">9</span> One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, “Come here. I will show you the wife, the Lamb’s bride.”   <span class="verse">10</span> He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,   <span class="verse">11</span> having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal;   <span class="verse">12</span> having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">13</span> On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates; and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
