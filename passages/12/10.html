		<span class="reference">Amos 3-4</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:  <span class="verse">2</span> “I have only chosen you of all the families of the earth.  Therefore I will punish you for all of your sins.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Do two walk together,  unless they have agreed?  <span class="verse">4</span> Will a lion roar in the thicket,  when he has no prey?  Does a young lion cry out of his den,  if he has caught nothing?  <span class="verse">5</span> Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth,  where no snare is set for him?  Does a snare spring up from the ground,  when there is nothing to catch?  <span class="verse">6</span> Does the trumpet alarm sound in a city,  without the people being afraid?  Does evil happen to a city,  and Yahweh hasn’t done it?  <span class="verse">7</span> Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing,  unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.  <span class="verse">8</span> The lion has roared.  Who will not fear?  The Lord Yahweh has spoken.  Who can but prophesy?  <span class="verse">9</span> Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod,  and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,  and say, “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria,  and see what unrest is in her,  and what oppression is among them.”  <span class="verse">10</span> “Indeed they don’t know to do right,” says Yahweh,  “Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore the Lord Yahweh says:  “An adversary will overrun the land;  and he will pull down your strongholds,  and your fortresses will be plundered.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh says:  “As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs,  or a piece of an ear,  so shall the children of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch,  and on the silken cushions of a bed.”  <span class="verse">13</span> “Listen, and testify against the house of Jacob,” says the Lord Yahweh, the God of Armies.  <span class="verse">14</span> “For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him,  I will also visit the altars of Bethel;  and the horns of the altar will be cut off,  and fall to the ground.  <span class="verse">15</span> I will strike the winter house with the summer house;  and the houses of ivory will perish,  and the great houses will have an end,”  says Yahweh.   <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> Listen to this word, you cows of Bashan, who are on the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who tell their husbands, “Bring us drinks!”  <span class="verse">2</span> The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness that behold,  “The days shall come on you that they will take you away with hooks,  and the last of you with fish hooks.  <span class="verse">3</span> You will go out at the breaks in the wall,  everyone straight before her;  and you will cast yourselves into Harmon,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Go to Bethel, and sin;  to Gilgal, and sin more.  Bring your sacrifices every morning,  your tithes every three days,  <span class="verse">5</span> offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,  and proclaim free will offerings and brag about them:  for this pleases you, you children of Israel,” says the Lord Yahweh.  <span class="verse">6</span> “I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,  and lack of bread in every town;  yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">7</span> “I also have withheld the rain from you,  when there were yet three months to the harvest;  and I caused it to rain on one city,  and caused it not to rain on another city.  One place was rained on,  and the piece where it didn’t rain withered.  <span class="verse">8</span> So two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water,  and were not satisfied:  yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">9</span> “I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your gardens and your vineyards;  and the swarming locusts have devoured your fig trees and your olive trees;  yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">10</span> “I sent plagues among you like I did Egypt.  I have slain your young men with the sword,  and have carried away your horses;  and I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camp,  yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">11</span> “I have overthrown some of you,  as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,  and you were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire;  yet you haven’t returned to me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">12</span> “Therefore thus I will do to you, Israel;  because I will do this to you,  prepare to meet your God, Israel.  <span class="verse">13</span> For, behold, he who forms the mountains,  and creates the wind,  and declares to man what is his thought;  who makes the morning darkness,  and treads on the high places of the earth:  Yahweh, the God of Armies, is his name.”

Days of affliction have taken hold of me.  <span class="verse">17</span> In the night season my bones are pierced in me,  and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.  <span class="verse">18</span> My garment is disfigured by great force.  It binds me about as the collar of my tunic.  <span class="verse">19</span> He has cast me into the mire.  I have become like dust and ashes.  <span class="verse">20</span> I cry to you, and you do not answer me.  I stand up, and you gaze at me.  <span class="verse">21</span> You have turned to be cruel to me.  With the might of your hand you persecute me.  <span class="verse">22</span> You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it.  You dissolve me in the storm.  <span class="verse">23</span> For I know that you will bring me to death,  To the house appointed for all living.  <span class="verse">24</span> “However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall?  Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?  <span class="verse">25</span> Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble?  Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy?  <span class="verse">26</span> When I looked for good, then evil came.  When I waited for light, darkness came.  <span class="verse">27</span> My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest.  Days of affliction have come on me.  <span class="verse">28</span> I go mourning without the sun.  I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.  <span class="verse">29</span> I am a brother to jackals,  and a companion to ostriches.  <span class="verse">30</span> My skin grows black and peels from me.  My bones are burned with heat.  <span class="verse">31</span> Therefore my harp has turned to mourning,  and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.

But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.  <span class="verse">26</span> In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,  <span class="verse">27</span> for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God.  <span class="verse">28</span> I came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.” <span class="verse">29</span> His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech.   <span class="verse">30</span> Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.”  <span class="verse">31</span> Jesus answered them,  “Do you now believe?  <span class="verse">32</span> Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.  <span class="verse">33</span> I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.”

		<span class="reference">Revelation 7</span>  <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.   <span class="verse">2</span> I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,   <span class="verse">3</span> saying, “Don’t harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!”   <span class="verse">4</span> I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:  <span class="verse">5</span> of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed,  of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,  of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,  <span class="verse">6</span> of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,  of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand,  of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,  <span class="verse">7</span> of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,  of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,  of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,  <span class="verse">8</span> of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand,  of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, and  of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.  <span class="verse">9</span> After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could count, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.   <span class="verse">10</span> They cried with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”  <span class="verse">11</span> All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne, and worshiped God,   <span class="verse">12</span> saying, “Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power, and might, be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”  <span class="verse">13</span> One of the elders answered, saying to me, “These who are arrayed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?”  <span class="verse">14</span> I told him, “My lord, you know.”  He said to me, “These are those who came out of the great suffering. They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb’s blood.   <span class="verse">15</span> Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle over them.   <span class="verse">16</span> They will never be hungry or thirsty any more. The sun won’t beat on them, nor any heat;   <span class="verse">17</span> for the Lamb who is in the middle of the throne shepherds them and leads them to springs of life-giving waters. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
