		<span class="reference">Zechariah 9-10</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> A revelation.  Yahweh’s word is against the land of Hadrach,  and will rest upon Damascus;  for the eye of man  and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh;  <span class="verse">2</span> and Hamath, also, which borders on it;  Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.  <span class="verse">3</span> Tyre built herself a stronghold,  and heaped up silver like the dust,  and fine gold like the mire of the streets.  <span class="verse">4</span> Behold, the Lord will dispossess her,  and he will strike her power in the sea;  and she will be devoured with fire.  <span class="verse">5</span> Ashkelon will see it, and fear;  Gaza also, and will writhe in agony;  as will Ekron, for her expectation will be disappointed;  and the king will perish from Gaza,  and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.  <span class="verse">6</span> Foreigners will dwell in Ashdod,  and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.  <span class="verse">7</span> I will take away his blood out of his mouth,  and his abominations from between his teeth;  and he also will be a remnant for our God;  and he will be as a chieftain in Judah,  and Ekron as a Jebusite.  <span class="verse">8</span> I will encamp around my house against the army,  that no one pass through or return;  and no oppressor will pass through them any more:  for now I have seen with my eyes.  <span class="verse">9</span> Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!  Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!  Behold, your King comes to you!  He is righteous, and having salvation;  lowly, and riding on a donkey,  even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.  <span class="verse">10</span> I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,  and the horse from Jerusalem;  and the battle bow will be cut off;  and he will speak peace to the nations:  and his dominion will be from sea to sea,  and from the River to the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse">11</span> As for you also,  because of the blood of your covenant,  I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.  <span class="verse">12</span> Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope!  Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.  <span class="verse">13</span> For indeed I bend Judah as a bow for me.  I have filled the bow with Ephraim;  and I will stir up your sons, Zion,  against your sons, Greece,  and will make you like the sword of a mighty man.  <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh will be seen over them;  and his arrow will go flash like lightning;  and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet,  and will go with whirlwinds of the south.  <span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh of Armies will defend them;  and they will destroy and overcome with sling stones;  and they will drink, and roar as through wine;  and they will be filled like bowls,  like the corners of the altar.  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people;  for they are like the jewels of a crown,  lifted on high over his land.  <span class="verse">17</span> For how great is his goodness,  and how great is his beauty!  Grain will make the young men flourish,  and new wine the virgins.   <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Ask of Yahweh rain in the spring time,  Yahweh who makes storm clouds,  and he gives rain showers to everyone for the plants in the field.  <span class="verse">2</span> For the teraphim  have spoken vanity,  and the diviners have seen a lie;  and they have told false dreams.  They comfort in vain.  Therefore they go their way like sheep.  They are oppressed, because there is no shepherd.  <span class="verse">3</span> My anger is kindled against the shepherds,  and I will punish the male goats;  For Yahweh of Armies has visited his flock, the house of Judah,  and will make them as his majestic horse in the battle.  <span class="verse">4</span> From him will come the cornerstone,  from him the nail,  from him the battle bow,  from him every ruler together.  <span class="verse">5</span> They shall be as mighty men,  treading down muddy streets in the battle;  and they shall fight, because Yahweh is with them;  and the riders on horses will be confounded.  <span class="verse">6</span> “I will strengthen the house of Judah,  and I will save the house of Joseph,  and I will bring them back;  for I have mercy on them;  and they will be as though I had not cast them off:  for I am Yahweh their God, and I will hear them.  <span class="verse">7</span> Ephraim will be like a mighty man,  and their heart will rejoice as through wine;  yes, their children will see it, and rejoice.  Their heart will be glad in Yahweh.  <span class="verse">8</span> I will signal for them, and gather them;  for I have redeemed them;  and they will increase as they have increased.  <span class="verse">9</span> I will sow them among the peoples;  and they will remember me in far countries;  and they will live with their children, and will return.  <span class="verse">10</span> I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt,  and gather them out of Assyria;  and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon;  and there won’t be room enough for them.  <span class="verse">11</span> He will pass through the sea of affliction,  and will strike the waves in the sea,  and all the depths of the Nile will dry up;  and the pride of Assyria will be brought down,  and the scepter of Egypt will depart.  <span class="verse">12</span> I will strengthen them in Yahweh;  and they will walk up and down in his name,” says Yahweh.

		<span class="reference">Job 40</span>  <span class="chapter">40</span><span class="verse">1</span> Moreover Yahweh answered Job,  <span class="verse">2</span> “Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty?  He who argues with God, let him answer it.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Then Job answered Yahweh,  <span class="verse">4</span> “Behold, I am of small account. What will I answer you?  I lay my hand on my mouth.  <span class="verse">5</span> I have spoken once, and I will not answer;  Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,  <span class="verse">7</span> “Now brace yourself like a man.  I will question you, and you will answer me.  <span class="verse">8</span> Will you even annul my judgment?  Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?  <span class="verse">9</span> Or do you have an arm like God?  Can you thunder with a voice like him?  <span class="verse">10</span> “Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.  Array yourself with honor and majesty.  <span class="verse">11</span> Pour out the fury of your anger.  Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.  <span class="verse">12</span> Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him.  Crush the wicked in their place.  <span class="verse">13</span> Hide them in the dust together.  Bind their faces in the hidden place.  <span class="verse">14</span> Then I will also admit to you  that your own right hand can save you.  <span class="verse">15</span> “See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you.  He eats grass as an ox.  <span class="verse">16</span> Look now, his strength is in his thighs.  His force is in the muscles of his belly.  <span class="verse">17</span> He moves his tail like a cedar.  The sinews of his thighs are knit together.  <span class="verse">18</span> His bones are like tubes of bronze.  His limbs are like bars of iron.  <span class="verse">19</span> He is the chief of the ways of God.  He who made him gives him his sword.  <span class="verse">20</span> Surely the mountains produce food for him,  where all the animals of the field play.  <span class="verse">21</span> He lies under the lotus trees,  in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.  <span class="verse">22</span> The lotuses cover him with their shade.  The willows of the brook surround him.  <span class="verse">23</span> Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble.  He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.  <span class="verse">24</span> Shall any take him when he is on the watch,  or pierce through his nose with a snare?

		<span class="reference">John 20:24-31</span>  <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">24</span> But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, wasn’t with them when Jesus came.   <span class="verse">25</span> The other disciples therefore said to him, “We have seen the Lord!”  But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”  <span class="verse">26</span> After eight days again his disciples were inside and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors being locked, and stood in the middle, and said,  “Peace be to you.” <span class="verse">27</span> Then he said to Thomas,  “Reach here your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my side. Don’t be unbelieving, but believing.” <span class="verse">28</span> Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”  <span class="verse">29</span> Jesus said to him,  “Because you have seen me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen, and have believed.” <span class="verse">30</span> Therefore Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;   <span class="verse">31</span> but these are written, that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.

		<span class="reference">Revelation 19:11-21</span>  <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">11</span> I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes war.   <span class="verse">12</span> His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has names written and a name written which no one knows but he himself.   <span class="verse">13</span> He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His name is called “The Word of God.”   <span class="verse">14</span> The armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses, clothed in white, pure, fine linen.   <span class="verse">15</span> Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword, that with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod.  He treads the wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.   <span class="verse">16</span> He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, “KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”  <span class="verse">17</span> I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, “Come! Be gathered together to the great supper of God, <span class="verse">18</span> that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, small and great.”   <span class="verse">19</span> I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against his army.   <span class="verse">20</span> The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.   <span class="verse">21</span> The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the horse, the sword which came out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with their flesh.
