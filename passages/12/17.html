		<span class="reference">Micah 4-5</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> But in the latter days,  it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh’s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,  and it will be exalted above the hills;  and peoples will stream to it.  <span class="verse">2</span> Many nations will go and say,  “Come! Let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,  and to the house of the God of Jacob;  and he will teach us of his ways,  and we will walk in his paths.”  For the law will go out of Zion,  and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem;  <span class="verse">3</span> and he will judge between many peoples,  and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.  They will beat their swords into plowshares,  and their spears into pruning hooks.  Nation will not lift up sword against nation,  neither will they learn war any more.  <span class="verse">4</span> But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;  and no one will make them afraid:  For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.   <span class="verse">5</span> Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;  but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.  <span class="verse">6</span> “In that day,” says Yahweh,  “I will assemble that which is lame,  and I will gather that which is driven away,  and that which I have afflicted;  <span class="verse">7</span> and I will make that which was lame a remnant,  and that which was cast far off a strong nation:  and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.”  <span class="verse">8</span> You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,  to you it will come,  yes, the former dominion will come,  the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">9</span> Now why do you cry out aloud?  Is there no king in you?  Has your counselor perished,  that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?  <span class="verse">10</span> Be in pain, and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion,  like a woman in travail;  for now you will go out of the city,  and will dwell in the field,  and will come even to Babylon.  There you will be rescued.  There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.  <span class="verse">11</span> Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,  “Let her be defiled,  and let our eye gloat over Zion.”  <span class="verse">12</span> But they don’t know the thoughts of Yahweh,  neither do they understand his counsel;  for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.  <span class="verse">13</span> Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion;  for I will make your horn iron,  and I will make your hoofs bronze;  and you will beat in pieces many peoples:  and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,  and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.   <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now you shall gather yourself in troops,  daughter of troops.  He has laid siege against us.  They will strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.  <span class="verse">2</span> But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,  being small among the clans of Judah,  out of you one will come out to me that is to be ruler in Israel;  whose goings out are from of old, from ancient times.  <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth.  Then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel.  <span class="verse">4</span> He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the strength of Yahweh,  in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God:  and they will live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse">5</span> He will be our peace when Assyria invades our land,  and when he marches through our fortresses,  then we will raise against him seven shepherds,  and eight leaders of men.  <span class="verse">6</span> They will rule the land of Assyria with the sword,  and the land of Nimrod in its gates.  He will deliver us from the Assyrian,  when he invades our land,  and when he marches within our border.  <span class="verse">7</span> The remnant of Jacob will be among many peoples,  like dew from Yahweh,  like showers on the grass,  that don’t wait for man,  nor wait for the sons of men.  <span class="verse">8</span> The remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,  among many peoples,  like a lion among the animals of the forest,  like a young lion among the flocks of sheep;  who, if he goes through, treads down and tears in pieces,  and there is no one to deliver.  <span class="verse">9</span> Let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries,  and let all of your enemies be cut off.  <span class="verse">10</span> “It will happen in that day”, says Yahweh,  “that I will cut off your horses out from among you,  and will destroy your chariots.  <span class="verse">11</span> I will cut off the cities of your land,  and will tear down all your strongholds.  <span class="verse">12</span> I will destroy witchcraft from your hand;  and you shall have no soothsayers.  <span class="verse">13</span> I will cut off your engraved images and your pillars out from among you;  and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.  <span class="verse">14</span> I will uproot your Asherah poles out from among you;  and I will destroy your cities.  <span class="verse">15</span> I will execute vengeance in anger,  and wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.”

		<span class="reference">Job 34:21-37</span>  <span class="chapter">34</span><span class="verse">21</span> “For his eyes are on the ways of a man.  He sees all his goings.  <span class="verse">22</span> There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,  where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.  <span class="verse">23</span> For he doesn’t need to consider a man further,  that he should go before God in judgment.  <span class="verse">24</span> He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out,  and sets others in their place.  <span class="verse">25</span> Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.  He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.  <span class="verse">26</span> He strikes them as wicked men  in the open sight of others;  <span class="verse">27</span> because they turned away from following him,  and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,  <span class="verse">28</span> so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.  He heard the cry of the afflicted.  <span class="verse">29</span> When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?  When he hides his face, who then can see him?  He is over a nation or a man alike,  <span class="verse">30</span> that the godless man may not reign,  that there be no one to ensnare the people.  <span class="verse">31</span> “For has any said to God,  ‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.  <span class="verse">32</span> Teach me that which I don’t see.  If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?  <span class="verse">33</span> Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?  For you must choose, and not I.  Therefore speak what you know.  <span class="verse">34</span> Men of understanding will tell me,  yes, every wise man who hears me:  <span class="verse">35</span> ‘Job speaks without knowledge.  His words are without wisdom.’  <span class="verse">36</span> I wish that Job were tried to the end,  because of his answering like wicked men.  <span class="verse">37</span> For he adds rebellion to his sin.  He claps his hands among us,  and multiplies his words against God.”

It was early, and they themselves didn’t enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.   <span class="verse">29</span> Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”  <span class="verse">30</span> They answered him, “If this man weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.”  <span class="verse">31</span> Pilate therefore said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”  Therefore the Jews said to him, “It is illegal for us to put anyone to death,”   <span class="verse">32</span> that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he should die.  <span class="verse">33</span> Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”  <span class="verse">34</span> Jesus answered him,  “Do you say this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?” <span class="verse">35</span> Pilate answered, “I’m not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What have you done?”  <span class="verse">36</span> Jesus answered,  “My Kingdom is not of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I wouldn’t be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is not from here.”

		<span class="reference">Revelation 12</span>  <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.   <span class="verse">2</span> She was with child. She cried out in pain, laboring to give birth.   <span class="verse">3</span> Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.   <span class="verse">4</span> His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.   <span class="verse">5</span> She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.   <span class="verse">6</span> The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days.  <span class="verse">7</span> There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.   <span class="verse">8</span> They didn’t prevail. No place was found for them any more in heaven.   <span class="verse">9</span> The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.   <span class="verse">10</span> I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now the salvation, the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ has come; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night.   <span class="verse">11</span> They overcame him because of the Lamb’s blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They didn’t love their life, even to death.   <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time.”  <span class="verse">13</span> When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.   <span class="verse">14</span> Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.   <span class="verse">15</span> The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.   <span class="verse">16</span> The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.   <span class="verse">17</span> The dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring,  who keep God’s commandments and hold Jesus’ testimony.
