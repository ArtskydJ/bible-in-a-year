		<span class="reference">Amos 8-9</span>  <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: behold, a basket of summer fruit.  <span class="verse">2</span> He said, “Amos, what do you see?”  I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”  Then Yahweh said to me,  “The end has come on my people Israel.  I will not again pass by them any more.  <span class="verse">3</span> The songs of the temple will be wailing in that day,” says the Lord Yahweh.  “The dead bodies will be many. In every place they will throw them out with silence.  <span class="verse">4</span> Hear this, you who desire to swallow up the needy,  and cause the poor of the land to fail,  <span class="verse">5</span> Saying, ‘When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain?  And the Sabbath, that we may market wheat,  making the ephah  small, and the shekel  large,  and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;  <span class="verse">6</span> that we may buy the poor for silver,  and the needy for a pair of sandals,  and sell the sweepings with the wheat?’ ”  <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob,  “Surely I will never forget any of their works.  <span class="verse">8</span> Won’t the land tremble for this,  and everyone mourn who dwells in it?  Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River;  and it will be stirred up and sink again, like the River of Egypt.  <span class="verse">9</span> It will happen in that day,” says the Lord Yahweh,  “that I will cause the sun to go down at noon,  and I will darken the earth in the clear day.  <span class="verse">10</span> I will turn your feasts into mourning,  and all your songs into lamentation;  and I will make you wear sackcloth on all your bodies,  and baldness on every head.  I will make it like the mourning for an only son,  and its end like a bitter day.  <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, the days come,” says the Lord Yahweh,  “that I will send a famine in the land,  not a famine of bread,  nor a thirst for water,  but of hearing Yahweh’s words.  <span class="verse">12</span> They will wander from sea to sea,  and from the north even to the east;  they will run back and forth to seek Yahweh’s word,  and will not find it.  <span class="verse">13</span> In that day the beautiful virgins  and the young men will faint for thirst.  <span class="verse">14</span> Those who swear by the sin of Samaria,  and say, ‘As your god, Dan, lives;’  and, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives;’  they will fall, and never rise up again.”   <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, “Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.   <span class="verse">2</span> Though they dig into Sheol,  there my hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down.   <span class="verse">3</span> Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.   <span class="verse">4</span> Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.   <span class="verse">5</span> For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.   <span class="verse">6</span> It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.   <span class="verse">7</span> Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?” says Yahweh. “Haven’t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?   <span class="verse">8</span> Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">9</span> “For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth.   <span class="verse">10</span> All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’   <span class="verse">11</span> In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;   <span class="verse">12</span> that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,” says Yahweh who does this.  <span class="verse">13</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,  “that the plowman shall overtake the reaper,  and the one treading grapes him who sows seed;  and sweet wine will drip from the mountains,  and flow from the hills.  <span class="verse">14</span> I will bring my people Israel back from captivity,  and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them;  and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them.  They shall also make gardens,  and eat their fruit.  <span class="verse">15</span> I will plant them on their land,  and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them,”  says Yahweh your God.

		<span class="reference">Job 32</span>  <span class="chapter">32</span><span class="verse">1</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.   <span class="verse">2</span> Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.   <span class="verse">3</span> Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.   <span class="verse">4</span> Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were elder than he.   <span class="verse">5</span> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.  <span class="verse">6</span> Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered,  “I am young, and you are very old;  Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.  <span class="verse">7</span> I said, ‘Days should speak,  and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’  <span class="verse">8</span> But there is a spirit in man,  and the Spirit  of the Almighty gives them understanding.  <span class="verse">9</span> It is not the great who are wise,  nor the aged who understand justice.  <span class="verse">10</span> Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me;  I also will show my opinion.’  <span class="verse">11</span> “Behold, I waited for your words,  and I listened for your reasoning,  while you searched out what to say.  <span class="verse">12</span> Yes, I gave you my full attention,  but there was no one who convinced Job,  or who answered his words, among you.  <span class="verse">13</span> Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom.  God may refute him, not man;’  <span class="verse">14</span> for he has not directed his words against me;  neither will I answer him with your speeches.  <span class="verse">15</span> “They are amazed. They answer no more.  They don’t have a word to say.  <span class="verse">16</span> Shall I wait, because they don’t speak,  because they stand still, and answer no more?  <span class="verse">17</span> I also will answer my part,  and I also will show my opinion.  <span class="verse">18</span> For I am full of words.  The spirit within me constrains me.  <span class="verse">19</span> Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent;  like new wineskins it is ready to burst.  <span class="verse">20</span> I will speak, that I may be refreshed.  I will open my lips and answer.  <span class="verse">21</span> Please don’t let me respect any man’s person,  neither will I give flattering titles to any man.  <span class="verse">22</span> For I don’t know how to give flattering titles,  or else my Maker would soon take me away.

		<span class="reference">Revelation 9:13-21</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">13</span> The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,   <span class="verse">14</span> saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!”  <span class="verse">15</span> The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind.   <span class="verse">16</span> The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million.  I heard the number of them.   <span class="verse">17</span> Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the horses’ heads resembled lions’ heads. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.   <span class="verse">18</span> By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.   <span class="verse">19</span> For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.   <span class="verse">20</span> The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn’t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn’t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can’t see, hear, or walk.   <span class="verse">21</span> They didn’t repent of their murders, their sorceries,  their sexual immorality, or their thefts.
