		<span class="reference">Hosea 10-12</span>  <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit.  According to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his altars.  As their land has prospered, they have adorned their sacred stones.  <span class="verse">2</span> Their heart is divided.  Now they will be found guilty.  He will demolish their altars.  He will destroy their sacred stones.  <span class="verse">3</span> Surely now they will say, “We have no king; for we don’t fear Yahweh;  and the king, what can he do for us?”  <span class="verse">4</span> They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants.  Therefore judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.  <span class="verse">5</span> The inhabitants of Samaria will be in terror for the calves of Beth Aven;  for its people will mourn over it,  Along with its priests who rejoiced over it,  for its glory, because it has departed from it.  <span class="verse">6</span> It also will be carried to Assyria for a present to a great king.  Ephraim will receive shame,  and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.  <span class="verse">7</span> Samaria and her king float away,  like a twig on the water.  <span class="verse">8</span> The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed.  The thorn and the thistle will come up on their altars.  They will tell the mountains, “Cover us!” and the hills, “Fall on us!”  <span class="verse">9</span> “Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah.  There they remained.  The battle against the children of iniquity doesn’t overtake them in Gibeah.  <span class="verse">10</span> When it is my desire, I will chastise them;  and the nations will be gathered against them,  when they are bound to their two transgressions.  <span class="verse">11</span> Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh;  so I will put a yoke on her beautiful neck.  I will set a rider on Ephraim.  Judah will plow.  Jacob will break his clods.  <span class="verse">12</span> Sow to yourselves in righteousness,  reap according to kindness.  Break up your fallow ground;  for it is time to seek Yahweh,  until he comes and rains righteousness on you.  <span class="verse">13</span> You have plowed wickedness.  You have reaped iniquity.  You have eaten the fruit of lies,  for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.  <span class="verse">14</span> Therefore a battle roar will arise among your people,  and all your fortresses will be destroyed,  as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle.  The mother was dashed in pieces with her children.  <span class="verse">15</span> So Bethel will do to you because of your great wickedness.  At daybreak the king of Israel will be destroyed.   <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> “When Israel was a child, then I loved him,  and called my son out of Egypt.  <span class="verse">2</span> They called to them, so they went from them.  They sacrificed to the Baals,  and burned incense to engraved images.  <span class="verse">3</span> Yet I taught Ephraim to walk.  I took them by his arms;  but they didn’t know that I healed them.  <span class="verse">4</span> I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love;  and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks;  and I bent down to him and I fed him.  <span class="verse">5</span> “They won’t return into the land of Egypt;  but the Assyrian will be their king,  because they refused to repent.  <span class="verse">6</span> The sword will fall on their cities,  and will destroy the bars of their gates,  and will put an end to their plans.  <span class="verse">7</span> My people are determined to turn from me.  Though they call to the Most High,  he certainly won’t exalt them.  <span class="verse">8</span> “How can I give you up, Ephraim?  How can I hand you over, Israel?  How can I make you like Admah?  How can I make you like Zeboiim?  My heart is turned within me,  my compassion is aroused.  <span class="verse">9</span> I will not execute the fierceness of my anger.  I will not return to destroy Ephraim:  for I am God, and not man; the Holy One among you;  and I will not come in wrath.  <span class="verse">10</span> They will walk after Yahweh,  who will roar like a lion;  for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west.  <span class="verse">11</span> They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt,  and like a dove out of the land of Assyria;  and I will settle them in their houses,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">12</span> Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood,  and the house of Israel with deceit.  Judah still strays from God,  and is unfaithful to the Holy One.   <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Ephraim feeds on wind,  and chases the east wind.  He continually multiplies lies and desolation.  They make a covenant with Assyria,  and oil is carried into Egypt.  <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah,  and will punish Jacob according to his ways;  according to his deeds he will repay him.  <span class="verse">3</span> In the womb he took his brother by the heel;  and in his manhood he contended with God.  <span class="verse">4</span> Indeed, he struggled with the angel, and prevailed;  he wept, and made supplication to him.  He found him at Bethel, and there he spoke with us,  <span class="verse">5</span> even Yahweh, the God of Armies;  Yahweh is his name of renown!  <span class="verse">6</span> Therefore turn to your God.  Keep kindness and justice,  and wait continually for your God.  <span class="verse">7</span> A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand.  He loves to defraud.  <span class="verse">8</span> Ephraim said, “Surely I have become rich,  I have found myself wealth.  In all my wealth they won’t find in me any iniquity that is sin.”  <span class="verse">9</span> “But I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt.  I will yet again make you dwell in tents,  as in the days of the solemn feast.  <span class="verse">10</span> I have also spoken to the prophets,  and I have multiplied visions;  and by the ministry of the prophets I have used parables.  <span class="verse">11</span> If Gilead is wicked,  surely they are worthless.  In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls.  Indeed, their altars are like heaps in the furrows of the field.  <span class="verse">12</span> Jacob fled into the country of Aram,  and Israel served to get a wife,  and for a wife he tended flocks and herds.  <span class="verse">13</span> By a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up out of Egypt,  and by a prophet he was preserved.  <span class="verse">14</span> Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger.  Therefore his blood will be left on him,  and his Lord  will repay his contempt.

His hand has pierced the swift serpent.  <span class="verse">14</span> Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways.  How small a whisper do we hear of him!  But the thunder of his power who can understand?”

He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.  <span class="verse">6</span> If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.  <span class="verse">7</span> If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you. <span class="verse">8</span> “In this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; and so you will be my disciples.
