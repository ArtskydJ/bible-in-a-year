		<span class="reference">Amos 6-7</span>  <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,  and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samaria,  the notable men of the chief of the nations,  to whom the house of Israel come!  <span class="verse">2</span> Go to Calneh, and see;  and from there go to Hamath the great;  then go down to Gath of the Philistines.  are they better than these kingdoms?  or is their border greater than your border?  <span class="verse">3</span> Those who put far away the evil day,  and cause the seat of violence to come near;  <span class="verse">4</span> Who lie on beds of ivory,  and stretch themselves on their couches,  and eat the lambs out of the flock,  and the calves out of the middle of the stall;  <span class="verse">5</span> who strum on the strings of a harp;  who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;  <span class="verse">6</span> who drink wine in bowls,  and anoint themselves with the best oils;  but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.  <span class="verse">7</span> Therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive;  and the feasting and lounging will end.  <span class="verse">8</span> “The Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself,” says Yahweh, the God of Armies:  “I abhor the pride of Jacob,  and detest his fortresses.  Therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it.  <span class="verse">9</span> It will happen, if there remain ten men in one house,  that they shall die.  <span class="verse">10</span> “When a man’s relative carries him, even he who burns him, to bring bodies out of the house, and asks him who is in the innermost parts of the house, ‘Is there yet any with you?’ And he says, ‘No;’ then he will say, ‘Hush! Indeed we must not mention Yahweh’s name.’  <span class="verse">11</span> “For, behold, Yahweh commands, and the great house will be smashed to pieces,  and the little house into bits.  <span class="verse">12</span> Do horses run on the rocky crags?  Does one plow there with oxen?  But you have turned justice into poison,  and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness;  <span class="verse">13</span> you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say,  ‘Haven’t we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength?’  <span class="verse">14</span> For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel,”  says Yahweh, the God of Armies;  “and they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.”   <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and behold, it was the latter growth after the king’s harvest.   <span class="verse">2</span> When they finished eating the grass of the land, then I said, “Lord Yahweh, forgive, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is small.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh relented concerning this. “It shall not be,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">4</span> Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me and behold, the Lord Yahweh called for judgment by fire; and it dried up the great deep, and would have devoured the land.   <span class="verse">5</span> Then I said, “Lord Yahweh, stop, I beg you! How could Jacob stand? For he is small.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh relented concerning this. “This also shall not be,” says the Lord Yahweh.  <span class="verse">7</span> Thus he showed me and behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand.   <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh said to me, “Amos, what do you see?”  I said, “A plumb line.”  Then the Lord said, “Behold, I will set a plumb line in the middle of my people Israel. I will not again pass by them any more.   <span class="verse">9</span> The high places of Isaac will be desolate, the sanctuaries of Israel will be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the middle of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words.   <span class="verse">11</span> For Amos says, ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’ ”  <span class="verse">12</span> Amaziah also said to Amos, “You seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:   <span class="verse">13</span> but don’t prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house!”  <span class="verse">14</span> Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a farmer of sycamore figs;   <span class="verse">15</span> and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’   <span class="verse">16</span> Now therefore listen to Yahweh’s word: ‘You say, Don’t prophesy against Israel, and don’t preach against the house of Isaac.’   <span class="verse">17</span> Therefore Yahweh says: ‘Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.’ ”

Behold, here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!  Let the accuser write my indictment!  <span class="verse">36</span> Surely I would carry it on my shoulder;  and I would bind it to me as a crown.  <span class="verse">37</span> I would declare to him the number of my steps.  as a prince would I go near to him.  <span class="verse">38</span> If my land cries out against me,  and its furrows weep together;  <span class="verse">39</span> if I have eaten its fruits without money,  or have caused its owners to lose their life,  <span class="verse">40</span> let briers grow instead of wheat,  and stinkweed instead of barley.”  The words of Job are ended.

		<span class="reference">John 17:6-19</span>  <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">6</span> I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.  <span class="verse">7</span> Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,  <span class="verse">8</span> for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came from you. They have believed that you sent me.  <span class="verse">9</span> I pray for them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.  <span class="verse">10</span> All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.  <span class="verse">11</span> I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.  <span class="verse">12</span> While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. I have kept those whom you have given me. None of them is lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.  <span class="verse">13</span> But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.  <span class="verse">14</span> I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.  <span class="verse">15</span> I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.  <span class="verse">16</span> They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.  <span class="verse">17</span> Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth. <span class="verse">18</span> As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.  <span class="verse">19</span> For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.

		<span class="reference">Revelation 9:1-12</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.   <span class="verse">2</span> He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a  burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.   <span class="verse">3</span> Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.   <span class="verse">4</span> They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don’t have God’s seal on their foreheads.   <span class="verse">5</span> They were given power, not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a person.   <span class="verse">6</span> In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.   <span class="verse">7</span> The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people’s faces.   <span class="verse">8</span> They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.   <span class="verse">9</span> They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.   <span class="verse">10</span> They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.   <span class="verse">11</span> They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is “Abaddon”,  but in Greek, he has the name “Apollyon”.  <span class="verse">12</span> The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.
