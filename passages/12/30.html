		<span class="reference">Malachi 1-2</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> A revelation, Yahweh’s  word to Israel by Malachi.  <span class="verse">2</span> “I have loved you,” says Yahweh.  Yet you say, “How have you loved us?”  “Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says Yahweh, “Yet I loved Jacob;   <span class="verse">3</span> but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.”   <span class="verse">4</span> Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places;” Yahweh of Armies says, “They shall build, but I will throw down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the people against whom Yahweh shows wrath forever.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Your eyes will see, and you will say, “Yahweh is great—even beyond the border of Israel!”  <span class="verse">6</span> “A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is the respect due me? Says Yahweh of Armies to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, ‘How have we despised your name?’   <span class="verse">7</span> You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ In that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is contemptible.’   <span class="verse">8</span> When you offer the blind for sacrifice, isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t that evil? Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person?” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">9</span> “Now, please entreat the favor of God,  that he may be gracious to us. With this, will he accept any of you?” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">10</span> “Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “neither will I accept an offering at your hand.   <span class="verse">11</span> For from the rising of the sun even to its going down, my name is great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the nations,” says Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">12</span> “But you profane it, in that you say, ‘Yahweh’s table is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.’   <span class="verse">13</span> You say also, ‘Behold,  what a weariness it is!’ and you have sniffed at it”, says Yahweh of Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at your hand?” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">14</span> “But the deceiver is cursed, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord  a defective thing; for I am a great King,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and my name is awesome among the nations.”   <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Now, you priests, this commandment is for you.   <span class="verse">2</span> If you will not listen, and if you will not take it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says Yahweh of Armies, “then I will send the curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed them already, because you do not take it to heart.   <span class="verse">3</span> Behold, I will rebuke your offspring,  and will spread dung on your faces, even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it.   <span class="verse">4</span> You will know that I have sent this commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">5</span> “My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him that he might be reverent toward me; and he was reverent toward me, and stood in awe of my name.   <span class="verse">6</span> The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity.   <span class="verse">7</span> For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">8</span> But you have turned away from the path. You have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,” says Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">9</span> “Therefore I have also made you contemptible and wicked before all the people, according to the way you have not kept my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.   <span class="verse">10</span> Don’t we all have one father? Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?   <span class="verse">11</span> Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.   <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">13</span> This again you do: you cover Yahweh’s altar with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, because he doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither receives it with good will at your hand.   <span class="verse">14</span> Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is your companion, and the wife of your covenant.   <span class="verse">15</span> Did he not make you one, although he had the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought godly offspring. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.   <span class="verse">16</span> One who hates and divorces”, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “covers his garment with violence!” says Yahweh of Armies. “Therefore pay attention to your spirit, that you don’t be unfaithful.   <span class="verse">17</span> You have wearied Yahweh with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we wearied him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in Yahweh’s sight, and he delights in them;’ or ‘Where is the God of justice?’

For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”

You know that I have affection for you.”  Jesus said to him,  “Feed my sheep.  <span class="verse">18</span> Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you don’t want to go.” <span class="verse">19</span> Now he said this, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said to him,  “Follow me.”

He measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand twelve stadia.  Its length, width, and height are equal.   <span class="verse">17</span> Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits,  by the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.   <span class="verse">18</span> The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure gold, like pure glass.   <span class="verse">19</span> The foundations of the city’s wall were adorned with all kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire;  the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;   <span class="verse">20</span> the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst.   <span class="verse">21</span> The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.   <span class="verse">22</span> I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and the Lamb, are its temple.   <span class="verse">23</span> The city has no need for the sun or moon to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.   <span class="verse">24</span> The nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.   <span class="verse">25</span> Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be no night there),   <span class="verse">26</span> and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it so that they may enter.   <span class="verse">27</span> There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
