		<span class="reference">Zechariah 7-8</span>  <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the fourth year of king Darius, Yahweh’s word came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Chislev.   <span class="verse">2</span> The people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem Melech, and their men, to entreat Yahweh’s favor,   <span class="verse">3</span> and to speak to the priests of the house of Yahweh of Armies, and to the prophets, saying, “Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?”  <span class="verse">4</span> Then the word of Yahweh of Armies came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">5</span> “Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these seventy years, did you at all fast to me, really to me?   <span class="verse">6</span> When you eat, and when you drink, don’t you eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?   <span class="verse">7</span> Aren’t these the words which Yahweh proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and its cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited?’ ”  <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh’s word came to Zechariah, saying,   <span class="verse">9</span> “Thus has Yahweh of Armies spoken, saying, ‘Execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion every man to his brother.   <span class="verse">10</span> Don’t oppress the widow, nor the fatherless, the foreigner, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.’   <span class="verse">11</span> But they refused to listen, and turned their backs, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.   <span class="verse">12</span> Yes, they made their hearts as hard as flint, lest they might hear the law, and the words which Yahweh of Armies had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets. Therefore great wrath came from Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">13</span> It has come to pass that, as he called, and they refused to listen, so they will call, and I will not listen,” said Yahweh of Armies;   <span class="verse">14</span> “but I will scatter them with a whirlwind among all the nations which they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned: for they made the pleasant land desolate.”   <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me.   <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh says: “I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the middle of Jerusalem. Jerusalem shall be called ‘The City of Truth;’ and the mountain of Yahweh of Armies, ‘The Holy Mountain.’ ”  <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “Old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.   <span class="verse">5</span> The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes?” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country;   <span class="verse">8</span> and I will bring them, and they will dwell within Jerusalem; and they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of Yahweh of Armies was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.   <span class="verse">10</span> For before those days there was no wages for man, nor any wages for an animal; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men everyone against his neighbor.   <span class="verse">11</span> But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days,” says Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">12</span> “For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.   <span class="verse">13</span> It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Don’t be afraid. Let your hands be strong.”  <span class="verse">14</span> For Yahweh of Armies says: “As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I didn’t repent;   <span class="verse">15</span> so again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Don’t be afraid.   <span class="verse">16</span> These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates,   <span class="verse">17</span> and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">18</span> The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me.   <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months shall be for the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.”  <span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “Many peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come;   <span class="verse">21</span> and the inhabitants of one shall go to another, saying, ‘Let’s go speedily to entreat the favor of Yahweh, and to seek Yahweh of Armies. I will go also.’   <span class="verse">22</span> Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Yahweh.”   <span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “In those days, ten men will take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they will take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, ‘We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’ ”

Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,  <span class="verse">17</span> because God has deprived her of wisdom,  neither has he imparted to her understanding.  <span class="verse">18</span> When she lifts up herself on high,  she scorns the horse and his rider.  <span class="verse">19</span> “Have you given the horse might?  Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?  <span class="verse">20</span> Have you made him to leap as a locust?  The glory of his snorting is awesome.  <span class="verse">21</span> He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength.  He goes out to meet the armed men.  <span class="verse">22</span> He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed,  neither does he turn back from the sword.  <span class="verse">23</span> The quiver rattles against him,  the flashing spear and the javelin.  <span class="verse">24</span> He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage,  neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.  <span class="verse">25</span> As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’  He smells the battle afar off,  the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.  <span class="verse">26</span> “Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars,  and stretches her wings toward the south?  <span class="verse">27</span> Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up,  and makes his nest on high?  <span class="verse">28</span> On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home,  on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.  <span class="verse">29</span> From there he spies out the prey.  His eyes see it afar off.  <span class="verse">30</span> His young ones also suck up blood.  Where the slain are, there he is.”

The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.   <span class="verse">21</span> Jesus therefore said to them again,  “Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.” <span class="verse">22</span> When he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them,  “Receive the Holy Spirit!  <span class="verse">23</span> If you forgive anyone’s sins, they have been forgiven them. If you retain anyone’s sins, they have been retained.”

Salvation, power, and glory belong to our God;   <span class="verse">2</span> for his judgments are true and righteous. For he has judged the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.”  <span class="verse">3</span> A second said, “Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever.”   <span class="verse">4</span> The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, “Amen! Hallelujah!”  <span class="verse">5</span> A voice came from the throne, saying, “Give praise to our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!”  <span class="verse">6</span> I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying, “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!   <span class="verse">7</span> Let’s rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let’s give the glory to him. For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready.”   <span class="verse">8</span> It was given to her that she would array herself in bright, pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.  <span class="verse">9</span> He said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb.’ ” He said to me, “These are true words of God.”  <span class="verse">10</span> I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me, “Look! Don’t do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy.”
