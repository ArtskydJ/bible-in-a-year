Has this ever happened in your days,  or in the days of your fathers?  <span class="verse">3</span> Tell your children about it,  and have your children tell their children,  and their children, another generation.  <span class="verse">4</span> What the swarming locust has left, the great locust has eaten.  What the great locust has left, the grasshopper has eaten.  What the grasshopper has left, the caterpillar has eaten.  <span class="verse">5</span> Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!  Wail, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine;  for it is cut off from your mouth.  <span class="verse">6</span> For a nation has come up on my land, strong, and without number.  His teeth are the teeth of a lion,  and he has the fangs of a lioness.  <span class="verse">7</span> He has laid my vine waste,  and stripped my fig tree.  He has stripped its bark, and thrown it away.  Its branches are made white.  <span class="verse">8</span> Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth for the husband of her youth!   <span class="verse">9</span> The meal offering and the drink offering are cut off from Yahweh’s house.  The priests, Yahweh’s ministers, mourn.  <span class="verse">10</span> The field is laid waste.  The land mourns, for the grain is destroyed,  The new wine has dried up,  and the oil languishes.  <span class="verse">11</span> Be confounded, you farmers!  Wail, you vineyard keepers;  for the wheat and for the barley;  for the harvest of the field has perished.  <span class="verse">12</span> The vine has dried up, and the fig tree withered;  the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree,  even all of the trees of the field are withered;  for joy has withered away from the sons of men.  <span class="verse">13</span> Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests!  Wail, you ministers of the altar.  Come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God, for the meal offering and the drink offering are withheld from your God’s house.  <span class="verse">14</span> Sanctify a fast.  Call a solemn assembly.  Gather the elders,  and all the inhabitants of the land, to the house of Yahweh, your God,  and cry to Yahweh.  <span class="verse">15</span> Alas for the day!  For the day of Yahweh is at hand,  and it will come as destruction from the Almighty.  <span class="verse">16</span> Isn’t the food cut off before our eyes;  joy and gladness from the house of our God?  <span class="verse">17</span> The seeds rot under their clods.  The granaries are laid desolate.  The barns are broken down, for the grain has withered.  <span class="verse">18</span> How the animals groan!  The herds of livestock are perplexed, because they have no pasture.  Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.  <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh, I cry to you,  For the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,  and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.  <span class="verse">20</span> Yes, the animals of the field pant to you,  for the water brooks have dried up,  And the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

They hang far from men, they swing back and forth.  <span class="verse">5</span> As for the earth, out of it comes bread;  Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.  <span class="verse">6</span> Sapphires come from its rocks.  It has dust of gold.  <span class="verse">7</span> That path no bird of prey knows,  neither has the falcon’s eye seen it.  <span class="verse">8</span> The proud animals have not trodden it,  nor has the fierce lion passed by there.  <span class="verse">9</span> He puts his hand on the flinty rock,  and he overturns the mountains by the roots.  <span class="verse">10</span> He cuts out channels among the rocks.  His eye sees every precious thing.  <span class="verse">11</span> He binds the streams that they don’t trickle.  The thing that is hidden he brings out to light.

But because you are not of the world, since I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.  <span class="verse">20</span> Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his lord.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.  <span class="verse">21</span> But they will do all these things to you for my name’s sake, because they don’t know him who sent me.  <span class="verse">22</span> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.  <span class="verse">23</span> He who hates me, hates my Father also.  <span class="verse">24</span> If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t have had sin. But now they have seen and also hated both me and my Father.  <span class="verse">25</span> But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’ <span class="verse">26</span> “When the Counselor has come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.  <span class="verse">27</span> You will also testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
