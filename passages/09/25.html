		<span class="reference">Isaiah 54-56</span>  <span class="chapter">54</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Sing, barren, you who didn’t give birth;  break out into singing, and cry aloud, you who didn’t travail with child:  for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">2</span> “Enlarge the place of your tent,  and let them stretch out the curtains of your habitations;  don’t spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.  <span class="verse">3</span> For you will spread out on the right hand and on the left;  and your offspring will possess the nations  and settle in desolate cities.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Don’t be afraid, for you will not be ashamed.  Don’t be confounded, for you will not be disappointed.  For you will forget the shame of your youth.  You will remember the reproach of your widowhood no more.  <span class="verse">5</span> For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Armies is his name.  The Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer.  He will be called the God of the whole earth.  <span class="verse">6</span> For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,  even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,” says your God.  <span class="verse">7</span> “For a small moment I have forsaken you,  but I will gather you with great mercies.  <span class="verse">8</span> In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment,  but with everlasting loving kindness I will have mercy on you,” says Yahweh your Redeemer.  <span class="verse">9</span> “For this is like the waters of Noah to me;  for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah will no more go over the earth,  so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.  <span class="verse">10</span> For the mountains may depart,  and the hills be removed;  but my loving kindness will not depart from you,  and my covenant of peace will not be removed,”  says Yahweh who has mercy on you.  <span class="verse">11</span> “You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted,  behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors,  and lay your foundations with sapphires.  <span class="verse">12</span> I will make your pinnacles of rubies,  your gates of sparkling jewels,  and all your walls of precious stones.  <span class="verse">13</span> All your children will be taught by Yahweh;  and your children’s peace will be great.  <span class="verse">14</span> You will be established in righteousness.  You will be far from oppression,  for you will not be afraid,  and far from terror,  for it shall not come near you.  <span class="verse">15</span> Behold, they may gather together, but not by me.  Whoever gathers together against you will fall because of you.  <span class="verse">16</span> “Behold, I have created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame,  and forges a weapon for his work;  and I have created the destroyer to destroy.  <span class="verse">17</span> No weapon that is formed against you will prevail;  and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment.  This is the heritage of Yahweh’s servants,  and their righteousness is of me,” says Yahweh.   <span class="chapter">55</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Hey! Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters!  Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat!  Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.  <span class="verse">2</span> Why do you spend money for that which is not bread,  and your labor for that which doesn’t satisfy?  Listen diligently to me, and eat that which is good,  and let your soul delight itself in richness.  <span class="verse">3</span> Turn your ear, and come to me.  Hear, and your soul will live.  I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.  <span class="verse">4</span> Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,  a leader and commander to the peoples.  <span class="verse">5</span> Behold, you shall call a nation that you don’t know;  and a nation that didn’t know you shall run to you,  because of Yahweh your God,  and for the Holy One of Israel;  for he has glorified you.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Seek Yahweh while he may be found.  Call on him while he is near.  <span class="verse">7</span> Let the wicked forsake his way,  and the unrighteous man his thoughts.  Let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him,  to our God, for he will freely pardon.  <span class="verse">8</span> “For my thoughts are not your thoughts,  and your ways are not my ways,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">9</span> “For as the heavens are higher than the earth,  so are my ways higher than your ways,  and my thoughts than your thoughts.  <span class="verse">10</span> For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,  and doesn’t return there, but waters the earth,  and makes it grow and bud,  and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;  <span class="verse">11</span> so is my word that goes out of my mouth:  it will not return to me void,  but it will accomplish that which I please,  and it will prosper in the thing I sent it to do.  <span class="verse">12</span> For you shall go out with joy,  and be led out with peace.  The mountains and the hills will break out before you into singing;  and all the trees of the fields will clap their hands.  <span class="verse">13</span> Instead of the thorn the cypress tree will come up;  and instead of the brier the myrtle tree will come up.  It will make a name for Yahweh,  for an everlasting sign that will not be cut off.”   <span class="chapter">56</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh says,  “Maintain justice  and do what is right,  for my salvation is near  and my righteousness will soon be revealed.  <span class="verse">2</span> Blessed is the man who does this,  and the son of man who holds it fast;  who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it  and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Let no foreigner who has joined himself to Yahweh speak, saying,  “Yahweh will surely separate me from his people.”  Do not let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”  <span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh says, “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,  choose the things that please me,  and hold fast to my covenant,  <span class="verse">5</span> I will give them in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters.  I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.  <span class="verse">6</span> Also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh  to serve him,  and to love Yahweh’s name,  to be his servants,  everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it,  and holds fast my covenant,  <span class="verse">7</span> I will bring these to my holy mountain,  and make them joyful in my house of prayer.  Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be accepted on my altar;  for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”  <span class="verse">8</span> The Lord Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says,  “I will yet gather others to him,  in addition to his own who are gathered.”  <span class="verse">9</span> All you animals of the field,  come to devour,  all you animals in the forest.  <span class="verse">10</span> His watchmen are blind.  They are all without knowledge.  They are all mute dogs.  They can’t bark—  dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.  <span class="verse">11</span> Yes, the dogs are greedy.  They can never have enough.  They are shepherds who can’t understand.  They have all turned to their own way,  each one to his gain, from every quarter.  <span class="verse">12</span> “Come,” say they, “I will get wine,  and we will fill ourselves with strong drink;  and tomorrow will be as today,  great beyond measure.”

Though he understands, yet he will not respond.  <span class="verse">20</span> Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?  There is more hope for a fool than for him.  <span class="verse">21</span> He who pampers his servant from youth  will have him become a son in the end.  <span class="verse">22</span> An angry man stirs up strife,  and a wrathful man abounds in sin.  <span class="verse">23</span> A man’s pride brings him low,  but one of lowly spirit gains honor.  <span class="verse">24</span> Whoever is an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul.  He takes an oath, but dares not testify.  <span class="verse">25</span> The fear of man proves to be a snare,  but whoever puts his trust in Yahweh is kept safe.  <span class="verse">26</span> Many seek the ruler’s favor,  but a man’s justice comes from Yahweh.  <span class="verse">27</span> A dishonest man detests the righteous,  and the upright in their ways detest the wicked.

The other women with them told these things to the apostles.   <span class="verse">11</span> These words seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them.   <span class="verse">12</span> But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.

Yes, he who had gladly received the promises was offering up his one and only son,   <span class="verse">18</span> to whom it was said, “Your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac,”  <span class="verse">19</span> concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him back from the dead.   <span class="verse">20</span> By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.   <span class="verse">21</span> By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.   <span class="verse">22</span> By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave instructions concerning his bones.   <span class="verse">23</span> By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.   <span class="verse">24</span> By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,   <span class="verse">25</span> choosing rather to share ill treatment with God’s people than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time,   <span class="verse">26</span> considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.   <span class="verse">27</span> By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.   <span class="verse">28</span> By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.   <span class="verse">29</span> By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.   <span class="verse">30</span> By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.   <span class="verse">31</span> By faith, Rahab the prostitute didn’t perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.
