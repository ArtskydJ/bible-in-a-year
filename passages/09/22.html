		<span class="reference">Isaiah 47-48</span>  <span class="chapter">47</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon.  Sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans.  For you will no longer be called tender and delicate.  <span class="verse">2</span> Take the millstones and grind flour.  Remove your veil, lift up your skirt, uncover your legs,  and wade through the rivers.  <span class="verse">3</span> Your nakedness will be uncovered.  Yes, your shame will be seen.  I will take vengeance,  and will spare no one.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name,  is the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse">5</span> “Sit in silence, and go into darkness,  daughter of the Chaldeans.  For you shall no longer be called  the mistress of kingdoms.  <span class="verse">6</span> I was angry with my people.  I profaned my inheritance  and gave them into your hand.  You showed them no mercy.  You laid a very heavy yoke on the aged.  <span class="verse">7</span> You said, ‘I will be a princess forever,’  so that you didn’t lay these things to your heart,  nor did you remember the results.  <span class="verse">8</span> “Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures,  who sit securely,  who say in your heart,  ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.  I won’t sit as a widow,  neither will I know the loss of children.’  <span class="verse">9</span> But these two things will come to you in a moment in one day,  the loss of children and widowhood.  They will come on you in their full measure,  in the multitude of your sorceries,  and the great abundance of your enchantments.  <span class="verse">10</span> For you have trusted in your wickedness.  You have said, ‘No one sees me.’  Your wisdom and your knowledge has perverted you.  You have said in your heart, ‘I am, and there is no one else besides me.’  <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore disaster will come on you.  You won’t know when it dawns.  Mischief will fall on you.  You won’t be able to put it away.  Desolation will come on you suddenly,  which you don’t understand.  <span class="verse">12</span> “Stand now with your enchantments  and with the multitude of your sorceries,  in which you have labored from your youth,  as if you might profit,  as if you might prevail.  <span class="verse">13</span> You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels.  Now let the astrologers, the stargazers, and the monthly prognosticators, stand up and save you from the things that will happen to you.  <span class="verse">14</span> Behold, they are like stubble.  The fire will burn them.  They won’t deliver themselves from the power of the flame.  It won’t be a coal to warm at  or a fire to sit by.  <span class="verse">15</span> The things that you labored in will be like this:  those who have trafficked with you from your youth will each wander in his own way.  There will be no one to save you.   <span class="chapter">48</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Hear this, house of Jacob,  you who are called by the name of Israel,  and have come out of the waters of Judah.  You swear by Yahweh’s name,  and make mention of the God of Israel,  but not in truth, nor in righteousness—  <span class="verse">2</span> for they call themselves citizens of the holy city,  and rely on the God of Israel;  Yahweh of Armies is his name.  <span class="verse">3</span> I have declared the former things from of old.  Yes, they went out of my mouth, and I revealed them.  I did them suddenly, and they happened.  <span class="verse">4</span> Because I knew that you are obstinate,  and your neck is an iron sinew,  and your brow bronze;  <span class="verse">5</span> therefore I have declared it to you from of old;  before it came to pass I showed it to you;  lest you should say, ‘My idol has done them.  My engraved image and my molten image has commanded them.’  <span class="verse">6</span> You have heard it.  Now see all this.  And you, won’t you declare it?  “I have shown you new things from this time,  even hidden things, which you have not known.  <span class="verse">7</span> They are created now, and not from of old.  Before today, you didn’t hear them,  lest you should say, ‘Behold, I knew them.’  <span class="verse">8</span> Yes, you didn’t hear.  Yes, you didn’t know.  Yes, from of old your ear was not opened,  for I knew that you dealt very treacherously,  and were called a transgressor from the womb.  <span class="verse">9</span> For my name’s sake, I will defer my anger,  and for my praise, I hold it back for you  so that I don’t cut you off.  <span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I have refined you,  but not as silver.  I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.  <span class="verse">11</span> For my own sake,  for my own sake, I will do it;  for how would my name be profaned?  I will not give my glory to another.  <span class="verse">12</span> “Listen to me, O Jacob,  and Israel my called:  I am he.  I am the first.  I am also the last.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth,  and my right hand has spread out the heavens.  when I call to them, they stand up together.  <span class="verse">14</span> “Assemble yourselves, all of you, and hear!  Who among them has declared these things?  He whom Yahweh loves will do what he likes to Babylon,  and his arm will be against the Chaldeans.  <span class="verse">15</span> I, even I, have spoken.  Yes, I have called him.  I have brought him  and he shall make his way prosperous.  <span class="verse">16</span> “Come near to me and hear this:  “From the beginning I have not spoken in secret;  from the time that it happened, I was there.”  Now the Lord Yahweh has sent me  with his Spirit.  <span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh,  your Redeemer,  the Holy One of Israel says:  “I am Yahweh your God,  who teaches you to profit,  who leads you by the way that you should go.  <span class="verse">18</span> Oh that you had listened to my commandments!  Then your peace would have been like a river  and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.  <span class="verse">19</span> Your offspring also would have been as the sand  and the descendants of your body like its grains.  His name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.”  <span class="verse">20</span> Leave Babylon!  Flee from the Chaldeans!  With a voice of singing announce this,  tell it even to the end of the earth:  say, “Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob!”  <span class="verse">21</span> They didn’t thirst when he led them through the deserts.  He caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them.  He also split the rock and the waters gushed out.  <span class="verse">22</span> “There is no peace”, says Yahweh, “for the wicked.”

If he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.” <span class="verse">39</span> But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.
