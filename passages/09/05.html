		<span class="reference">Isaiah 9-10</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.  <span class="verse">2</span> The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light.  The light has shined on those who lived in the land of the shadow of death.  <span class="verse">3</span> You have multiplied the nation.  You have increased their joy.  They rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the plunder.   <span class="verse">4</span> For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian.   <span class="verse">5</span> For all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle, and the garments rolled in blood, will be for burning, fuel for the fire.   <span class="verse">6</span> For a child is born to us. A son is given to us; and the government will be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.   <span class="verse">7</span> Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on David’s throne, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from that time on, even forever. The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.  <span class="verse">8</span> The Lord sent a word into Jacob,  and it falls on Israel.  <span class="verse">9</span> All the people will know,  including Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,  <span class="verse">10</span> “The bricks have fallen,  but we will build with cut stone.  The sycamore fig trees have been cut down,  but we will put cedars in their place.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin,  and will stir up his enemies,  <span class="verse">12</span> The Syrians in front,  and the Philistines behind;  and they will devour Israel with open mouth.  For all this, his anger is not turned away,  but his hand is stretched out still.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them,  neither have they sought Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail,  palm branch and reed, in one day.  <span class="verse">15</span> The elder and the honorable man is the head,  and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail.  <span class="verse">16</span> For those who lead this people lead them astray;  and those who are led by them are destroyed.  <span class="verse">17</span> Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men,  neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows;  for everyone is profane and an evildoer,  and every mouth speaks folly.  For all this his anger is not turned away,  but his hand is stretched out still.  <span class="verse">18</span> For wickedness burns like a fire.  It devours the briers and thorns;  yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest,  and they roll upward in a column of smoke.  <span class="verse">19</span> Through Yahweh of Armies’ wrath, the land is burned up;  and the people are the fuel for the fire.  No one spares his brother.  <span class="verse">20</span> One will devour on the right hand, and be hungry;  and he will eat on the left hand, and they will not be satisfied.  Everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm:  <span class="verse">21</span> Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah.  For all this his anger is not turned away,  but his hand is stretched out still.   <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, and to the writers who write oppressive decrees;   <span class="verse">2</span> to deprive the needy from justice, and to rob the poor among my people of their rights, that widows may be their plunder, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!   <span class="verse">3</span> What will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?  <span class="verse">4</span> They will only bow down under the prisoners,  and will fall under the slain.  For all this his anger is not turned away,  but his hand is stretched out still.  <span class="verse">5</span> Alas Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!   <span class="verse">6</span> I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people who anger me I will give him a command to take the plunder and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.   <span class="verse">7</span> However he doesn’t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.   <span class="verse">8</span> For he says, “Aren’t all of my princes kings?   <span class="verse">9</span> Isn’t Calno like Carchemish? Isn’t Hamath like Arpad? Isn’t Samaria like Damascus?”   <span class="verse">10</span> As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, whose engraved images exceeded those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;   <span class="verse">11</span> shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?  <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore it will happen that when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the willful proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the insolence of his arrogant looks.   <span class="verse">13</span> For he has said, “By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have understanding. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures. Like a valiant man I have brought down their rulers.   <span class="verse">14</span> My hand has found the riches of the peoples like a nest, and like one gathers eggs that are abandoned, I have gathered all the earth. There was no one who moved their wing, or that opened their mouth, or chirped.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Should an ax brag against him who chops with it? Should a saw exalt itself above him who saws with it? As if a rod should lift those who lift it up, or as if a staff should lift up someone who is not wood.   <span class="verse">16</span> Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory a burning will be kindled like the burning of fire.   <span class="verse">17</span> The light of Israel will be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day.   <span class="verse">18</span> He will consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body. It will be as when a standard bearer faints.   <span class="verse">19</span> The remnant of the trees of his forest shall be few, so that a child could write their number.  <span class="verse">20</span> It will come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel, and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them, but shall lean on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.   <span class="verse">21</span> A remnant will return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.   <span class="verse">22</span> For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. A destruction is determined, overflowing with righteousness.   <span class="verse">23</span> For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will make a full end, and that determined, throughout all the earth.  <span class="verse">24</span> Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, says “My people who dwell in Zion, don’t be afraid of the Assyrian, though he strike you with the rod, and lift up his staff against you, as Egypt did.   <span class="verse">25</span> For yet a very little while, and the indignation against you will be accomplished, and my anger will be directed to his destruction.”   <span class="verse">26</span> Yahweh of Armies will stir up a scourge against him, as in the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb. His rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt.   <span class="verse">27</span> It will happen in that day that his burden will depart from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing oil.  <span class="verse">28</span> He has come to Aiath. He has passed through Migron. At Michmash he stores his baggage.   <span class="verse">29</span> They have gone over the pass. They have taken up their lodging at Geba. Ramah trembles. Gibeah of Saul has fled.   <span class="verse">30</span> Cry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim! Listen, Laishah! You poor Anathoth!   <span class="verse">31</span> Madmenah is a fugitive. The inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.   <span class="verse">32</span> This very day he will halt at Nob. He shakes his hand at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">33</span> Behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, will lop the boughs with terror. The tall will be cut down, and the lofty will be brought low.   <span class="verse">34</span> He will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.

Whoever is led astray by them is not wise.  <span class="verse">2</span> The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion.  He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life.  <span class="verse">3</span> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife,  but every fool will be quarreling.  <span class="verse">4</span> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;  therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.  <span class="verse">5</span> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water,  but a man of understanding will draw it out.  <span class="verse">6</span> Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,  but who can find a faithful man?  <span class="verse">7</span> A righteous man walks in integrity.  Blessed are his children after him.  <span class="verse">8</span> A king who sits on the throne of judgment  scatters away all evil with his eyes.  <span class="verse">9</span> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure.  I am clean and without sin?”  <span class="verse">10</span> Differing weights and differing measures,  both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.  <span class="verse">11</span> Even a child makes himself known by his doings,  whether his work is pure, and whether it is right.  <span class="verse">12</span> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,  Yahweh has made even both of them.  <span class="verse">13</span> Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.  Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread.  <span class="verse">14</span> “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the buyer;  but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.  <span class="verse">15</span> There is gold and abundance of rubies,  but the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel.

		<span class="reference">Luke 21:29-38</span>  <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">29</span> He told them a parable.  “See the fig tree and all the trees.  <span class="verse">30</span> When they are already budding, you see it and know by your own selves that the summer is already near.  <span class="verse">31</span> Even so you also, when you see these things happening, know that God’s Kingdom is near.  <span class="verse">32</span> Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all things are accomplished.  <span class="verse">33</span> Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away. <span class="verse">34</span> “So be careful, or your hearts will be loaded down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day will come on you suddenly.  <span class="verse">35</span> For it will come like a snare on all those who dwell on the surface of all the earth.  <span class="verse">36</span> Therefore be watchful all the time, praying that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.” <span class="verse">37</span> Every day Jesus was teaching in the temple, and every night he would go out and spend the night on the mountain that is called Olivet.   <span class="verse">38</span> All the people came early in the morning to him in the temple to hear him.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 3:1-11</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus,   <span class="verse">2</span> who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house.   <span class="verse">3</span> For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house.   <span class="verse">4</span> For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God.   <span class="verse">5</span> Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken,   <span class="verse">6</span> but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.   <span class="verse">7</span> Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says,  “Today if you will hear his voice,  <span class="verse">8</span> don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,  like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,  <span class="verse">9</span> where your fathers tested me and tried me,  and saw my deeds for forty years.  <span class="verse">10</span> Therefore I was displeased with that generation,  and said, ‘They always err in their heart,  but they didn’t know my ways.’  <span class="verse">11</span> As I swore in my wrath,  ‘They will not enter into my rest.’ ”
