		<span class="reference">Isaiah 40-41</span>  <span class="chapter">40</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God.   <span class="verse">2</span> “Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of Yahweh’s hand double for all her sins.”  <span class="verse">3</span> The voice of one who calls out,  “Prepare the way of Yahweh in the wilderness!  Make a level highway in the desert for our God.  <span class="verse">4</span> Every valley shall be exalted,  and every mountain and hill shall be made low.  The uneven shall be made level,  and the rough places a plain.  <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh’s glory shall be revealed,  and all flesh shall see it together;  for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.”  <span class="verse">6</span> The voice of one saying, “Cry!”  One said, “What shall I cry?”  “All flesh is like grass,  and all its glory is like the flower of the field.  <span class="verse">7</span> The grass withers,  the flower fades,  because Yahweh’s breath blows on it.  Surely the people are like grass.  <span class="verse">8</span> The grass withers,  the flower fades;  but the word of our God stands forever.”  <span class="verse">9</span> You who tell good news to Zion, go up on a high mountain.  You who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength!  Lift it up! Don’t be afraid!  Say to the cities of Judah, “Behold, your God!”  <span class="verse">10</span> Behold, the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one,  and his arm will rule for him.  Behold, his reward is with him,  and his recompense before him.  <span class="verse">11</span> He will feed his flock like a shepherd.  He will gather the lambs in his arm,  and carry them in his bosom.  He will gently lead those who have their young.  <span class="verse">12</span> Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,  and marked off the sky with his span,  and calculated the dust of the earth in a measuring basket,  and weighed the mountains in scales,  and the hills in a balance?  <span class="verse">13</span> Who has directed Yahweh’s Spirit,  or has taught him as his counselor?  <span class="verse">14</span> Who did he take counsel with,  and who instructed him,  and taught him in the path of justice,  and taught him knowledge,  and showed him the way of understanding?  <span class="verse">15</span> Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket,  and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance.  Behold, he lifts up the islands like a very little thing.  <span class="verse">16</span> Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,  nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering.  <span class="verse">17</span> All the nations are like nothing before him.  They are regarded by him as less than nothing, and vanity.  <span class="verse">18</span> To whom then will you liken God?  Or what likeness will you compare to him?  <span class="verse">19</span> A workman has cast an image,  and the goldsmith overlays it with gold,  and casts silver chains for it.  <span class="verse">20</span> He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot.  He seeks a skillful workman to set up a carved image for him that will not be moved.  <span class="verse">21</span> Haven’t you known?  Haven’t you heard?  Haven’t you been told from the beginning?  Haven’t you understood from the foundations of the earth?  <span class="verse">22</span> It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,  and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;  who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,  and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in,  <span class="verse">23</span> who brings princes to nothing,  who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.  <span class="verse">24</span> They are planted scarcely.  They are sown scarcely.  Their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground.  He merely blows on them, and they wither,  and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.  <span class="verse">25</span> “To whom then will you liken me?  Who is my equal?” says the Holy One.  <span class="verse">26</span> Lift up your eyes on high,  and see who has created these,  who brings out their army by number.  He calls them all by name.  by the greatness of his might,  and because he is strong in power,  not one is lacking.  <span class="verse">27</span> Why do you say, Jacob,  and speak, Israel,  “My way is hidden from Yahweh,  and the justice due me is disregarded by my God?”  <span class="verse">28</span> Haven’t you known?  Haven’t you heard?  The everlasting God, Yahweh,  the Creator of the ends of the earth, doesn’t faint.  He isn’t weary.  His understanding is unsearchable.  <span class="verse">29</span> He gives power to the weak.  He increases the strength of him who has no might.  <span class="verse">30</span> Even the youths faint and get weary,  and the young men utterly fall;  <span class="verse">31</span> but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength.  They will mount up with wings like eagles.  They will run, and not be weary.  They will walk, and not faint.   <span class="chapter">41</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Keep silent before me, islands,  and let the peoples renew their strength.  Let them come near,  then let them speak.  Let’s meet together for judgment.  <span class="verse">2</span> Who has raised up one from the east?  Who called him to his foot in righteousness?  He hands over nations to him  and makes him rule over kings.  He gives them like the dust to his sword,  like the driven stubble to his bow.  <span class="verse">3</span> He pursues them  and passes by safely,  even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.  <span class="verse">4</span> Who has worked and done it,  calling the generations from the beginning?  I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last, I am he.”  <span class="verse">5</span> The islands have seen, and fear.  The ends of the earth tremble.  They approach, and come.  <span class="verse">6</span> Everyone helps his neighbor.  They say to their brothers, “Be strong!”  <span class="verse">7</span> So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith.  He who smoothes with the hammer encourages him who strikes the anvil,  saying of the soldering, “It is good;”  and he fastens it with nails, that it might not totter.  <span class="verse">8</span> “But you, Israel, my servant,  Jacob whom I have chosen,  the offspring of Abraham my friend,  <span class="verse">9</span> You whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth,  and called from its corners,  and said to you, ‘You are my servant, I have chosen you and have not cast you away.’  <span class="verse">10</span> Don’t you be afraid, for I am with you.  Don’t be dismayed, for I am your God.  I will strengthen you.  Yes, I will help you.  Yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.  <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, all those who are incensed against you will be disappointed and confounded.  Those who strive with you will be like nothing, and shall perish.  <span class="verse">12</span> You will seek them, and won’t find them,  even those who contend with you.  Those who war against you will be as nothing,  as a non-existent thing.  <span class="verse">13</span> For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand,  saying to you, ‘Don’t be afraid.  I will help you.’  <span class="verse">14</span> Don’t be afraid, you worm Jacob,  and you men of Israel.  I will help you,” says Yahweh.  “Your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse">15</span> Behold, I have made you into a new sharp threshing instrument with teeth.  You will thresh the mountains,  and beat them small,  and will make the hills like chaff.  <span class="verse">16</span> You will winnow them,  and the wind will carry them away,  and the whirlwind will scatter them.  You will rejoice in Yahweh.  You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse">17</span> The poor and needy seek water, and there is none.  Their tongue fails for thirst.  I, Yahweh, will answer them.  I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.  <span class="verse">18</span> I will open rivers on the bare heights,  and springs in the middle of the valleys.  I will make the wilderness a pool of water,  and the dry land springs of water.  <span class="verse">19</span> I will put cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oil trees in the wilderness.  I will set cypress trees, pine, and box trees together in the desert;  <span class="verse">20</span> that they may see, know, consider, and understand together,  that Yahweh’s hand has done this,  and the Holy One of Israel has created it.  <span class="verse">21</span> Produce your cause,” says Yahweh.  “Bring out your strong reasons!” says the King of Jacob.  <span class="verse">22</span> “Let them announce and declare to us what will happen!  Declare the former things, what they are,  that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them;  or show us things to come.  <span class="verse">23</span> Declare the things that are to come hereafter,  that we may know that you are gods.  Yes, do good, or do evil,  that we may be dismayed,  and see it together.  <span class="verse">24</span> Behold, you are nothing,  and your work is nothing.  He who chooses you is an abomination.  <span class="verse">25</span> “I have raised up one from the north, and he has come,  from the rising of the sun, one who calls on my name,  and he shall come on rulers as on mortar,  and as the potter treads clay.  <span class="verse">26</span> Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?  and before, that we may say, ‘He is right?’  Surely, there is no one who declares.  Surely, there is no one who shows.  Surely, there is no one who hears your words.  <span class="verse">27</span> I am the first to say to Zion, ‘Behold, look at them;’  and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">28</span> When I look, there is no man,  even among them there is no counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.  <span class="verse">29</span> Behold, all of their deeds are vanity and nothing.  Their molten images are wind and confusion.

There is more hope for a fool than for him.  <span class="verse">13</span> The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road!  A fierce lion roams the streets!”  <span class="verse">14</span> As the door turns on its hinges,  so does the sluggard on his bed.  <span class="verse">15</span> The sluggard buries his hand in the dish.  He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.  <span class="verse">16</span> The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes  than seven men who answer with discretion.

Crucify him!”  <span class="verse">22</span> He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”   <span class="verse">23</span> But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.   <span class="verse">24</span> Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.   <span class="verse">25</span> He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 9:11-21</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">11</span> But Christ having come as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,   <span class="verse">12</span> nor yet through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption.   <span class="verse">13</span> For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify to the cleanness of the flesh,   <span class="verse">14</span> how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?   <span class="verse">15</span> For this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.   <span class="verse">16</span> For where a last will and testament is, there must of necessity be the death of him who made it.   <span class="verse">17</span> For a will is in force where there has been death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives.   <span class="verse">18</span> Therefore even the first covenant has not been dedicated without blood.   <span class="verse">19</span> For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,   <span class="verse">20</span> saying, “This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.” <span class="verse">21</span> Moreover he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the same way with the blood.
