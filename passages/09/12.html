		<span class="reference">Isaiah 27-28</span>  <span class="chapter">27</span><span class="verse">1</span> In that day, Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan, the fleeing serpent, and leviathan the twisted serpent; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.  <span class="verse">2</span> In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard!   <span class="verse">3</span> I, Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day.   <span class="verse">4</span> Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together.   <span class="verse">5</span> Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.”  <span class="verse">6</span> In days to come, Jacob will take root. Israel will blossom and bud. They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.   <span class="verse">7</span> Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them? Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?   <span class="verse">8</span> In measure, when you send them away, you contend with them. He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.   <span class="verse">9</span> Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.   <span class="verse">10</span> For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches.   <span class="verse">11</span> When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off. The women will come and set them on fire, for they are a people of no understanding. Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them, and he who formed them will show them no favor.  <span class="verse">12</span> It will happen in that day that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt; and you will be gathered one by one, children of Israel.  <span class="verse">13</span> It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown; and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt, shall come; and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.   <span class="chapter">28</span><span class="verse">1</span> Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine!   <span class="verse">2</span> Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one. Like a storm of hail, a destroying storm, and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing, he will cast them down to the earth with his hand.   <span class="verse">3</span> The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot.   <span class="verse">4</span> The fading flower of his glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it.   <span class="verse">5</span> In that day, Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the residue of his people,   <span class="verse">6</span> and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.  <span class="verse">7</span> They also reel with wine, and stagger with strong drink. The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink. They are swallowed up by wine. They stagger with strong drink. They err in vision. They stumble in judgment.   <span class="verse">8</span> For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.  <span class="verse">9</span> Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?   <span class="verse">10</span> For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.  <span class="verse">11</span> But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language,   <span class="verse">12</span> to whom he said, “This is the resting place. Give rest to weary,” and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not hear.   <span class="verse">13</span> Therefore Yahweh’s word will be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, fall backward, be broken, be snared, and be taken.  <span class="verse">14</span> Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem:   <span class="verse">15</span> “Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and we are in agreement with Sheol.   When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’ ”   <span class="verse">16</span> Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily.   <span class="verse">17</span> I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place.   <span class="verse">18</span> Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol   shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down by it.   <span class="verse">19</span> As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.”   <span class="verse">20</span> For the bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.   <span class="verse">21</span> For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim. He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his unusual work, and bring to pass his act, his extraordinary act.   <span class="verse">22</span> Now therefore don’t be scoffers, lest your bonds be made strong; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, on the whole earth.  <span class="verse">23</span> Give ear, and hear my voice! Listen, and hear my speech!   <span class="verse">24</span> Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?   <span class="verse">25</span> When he has leveled its surface, doesn’t he plant the dill, and scatter the cumin seed, and put in the wheat in rows, the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its place?   <span class="verse">26</span> For his God instructs him in right judgment and teaches him.   <span class="verse">27</span> For the dill are not threshed with a sharp instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin; but the dill is beaten out with a stick, and the cumin with a rod.   <span class="verse">28</span> Bread flour must be ground; so he will not always be threshing it. Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it, his horses don’t grind it.   <span class="verse">29</span> This also comes out from Yahweh of Armies, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.

Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.  <span class="verse">24</span> The father of the righteous has great joy.  Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.  <span class="verse">25</span> Let your father and your mother be glad!  Let her who bore you rejoice!  <span class="verse">26</span> My son, give me your heart;  and let your eyes keep in my ways.  <span class="verse">27</span> For a prostitute is a deep pit;  and a wayward wife is a narrow well.  <span class="verse">28</span> Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,  and increases the unfaithful among men.  <span class="verse">29</span> Who has woe?  Who has sorrow?  Who has strife?  Who has complaints?  Who has needless bruises?  Who has bloodshot eyes?  <span class="verse">30</span> Those who stay long at the wine;  those who go to seek out mixed wine.  <span class="verse">31</span> Don’t look at the wine when it is red,  when it sparkles in the cup,  when it goes down smoothly.  <span class="verse">32</span> In the end, it bites like a snake,  and poisons like a viper.  <span class="verse">33</span> Your eyes will see strange things,  and your mind will imagine confusing things.  <span class="verse">34</span> Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the middle of the sea,  or as he who lies on top of the rigging:  <span class="verse">35</span> “They hit me, and I was not hurt!  They beat me, and I don’t feel it!  When will I wake up? I can do it again.  I can find another.”

He came near to Jesus to kiss him.   <span class="verse">48</span> But Jesus said to him,  “Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?” <span class="verse">49</span> When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”   <span class="verse">50</span> A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.  <span class="verse">51</span> But Jesus answered,  “Let me at least do this” —and he touched his ear, and healed him.   <span class="verse">52</span> Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him,  “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?  <span class="verse">53</span> When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 7:1-10</span>  <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,   <span class="verse">2</span> to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of all (being first, by interpretation, “king of righteousness”, and then also “king of Salem”, which means “king of peace”,   <span class="verse">3</span> without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.  <span class="verse">4</span> Now consider how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth out of the best plunder.   <span class="verse">5</span> They indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though these have come out of the body of Abraham,   <span class="verse">6</span> but he whose genealogy is not counted from them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the promises.   <span class="verse">7</span> But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater.   <span class="verse">8</span> Here people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives.   <span class="verse">9</span> We can say that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,   <span class="verse">10</span> for he was yet in the body of his father when Melchizedek met him.
