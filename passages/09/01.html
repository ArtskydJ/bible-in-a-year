		<span class="reference">Isaiah 1</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.  <span class="verse">2</span> Hear, heavens,  and listen, earth; for Yahweh  has spoken:  “I have nourished and brought up children  and they have rebelled against me.  <span class="verse">3</span> The ox knows his owner,  and the donkey his master’s crib;  but Israel doesn’t know.  My people don’t consider.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Ah sinful nation,  a people loaded with iniquity,  offspring  of evildoers,  children who deal corruptly!  They have forsaken Yahweh.  They have despised the Holy One of Israel.  They are estranged and backward.  <span class="verse">5</span> Why should you be beaten more,  that you revolt more and more?  The whole head is sick,  and the whole heart faint.  <span class="verse">6</span> From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it:  wounds, welts, and open sores.  They haven’t been closed, bandaged, or soothed with oil.  <span class="verse">7</span> Your country is desolate.  Your cities are burned with fire.  Strangers devour your land in your presence  and it is desolate,  as overthrown by strangers.  <span class="verse">8</span> The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard,  like a hut in a field of melons,  like a besieged city.  <span class="verse">9</span> Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant,  we would have been as Sodom.  We would have been like Gomorrah.  <span class="verse">10</span> Hear Yahweh’s word, you rulers of Sodom!  Listen to the law of our God,  you people of Gomorrah!  <span class="verse">11</span> “What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?”, says Yahweh.  “I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams  and the fat of fed animals.  I don’t delight in the blood of bulls,  or of lambs,  or of male goats.  <span class="verse">12</span> When you come to appear before me,  who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?  <span class="verse">13</span> Bring no more vain offerings.  Incense is an abomination to me.  New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations:  I can’t stand evil assemblies.  <span class="verse">14</span> My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts.  They are a burden to me.  I am weary of bearing them.  <span class="verse">15</span> When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you.  Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear.  Your hands are full of blood.  <span class="verse">16</span> Wash yourselves. Make yourself clean.  Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes.  Cease to do evil.  <span class="verse">17</span> Learn to do well.  Seek justice.  Relieve the oppressed.  Defend the fatherless.  Plead for the widow.”  <span class="verse">18</span> “Come now, and let’s reason together,” says Yahweh:  “Though your sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.  Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.  <span class="verse">19</span> If you are willing and obedient,  you will eat the good of the land;  <span class="verse">20</span> but if you refuse and rebel, you will be devoured with the sword;  for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.”  <span class="verse">21</span> How the faithful city has become a prostitute!  She was full of justice.  Righteousness lodged in her,  but now there are murderers.  <span class="verse">22</span> Your silver has become dross,  your wine mixed with water.  <span class="verse">23</span> Your princes are rebellious and companions of thieves.  Everyone loves bribes and follows after rewards.  They don’t defend the fatherless,  neither does the cause of the widow come to them.  <span class="verse">24</span> Therefore the Lord,  Yahweh of Armies,  the Mighty One of Israel, says:  “Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries,  and avenge myself on my enemies.  <span class="verse">25</span> I will turn my hand on you,  thoroughly purge away your dross,  and will take away all your tin. <span class="verse">26</span> I will restore your judges as at the first,  and your counselors as at the beginning.  Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness,  a faithful town.’  <span class="verse">27</span> Zion shall be redeemed with justice,  and her converts with righteousness.  <span class="verse">28</span> But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together,  and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.  <span class="verse">29</span> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired,  and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.  <span class="verse">30</span> For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades,  and as a garden that has no water.  <span class="verse">31</span> The strong will be like tinder,  and his work like a spark.  They will both burn together,  and no one will quench them.”

The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.  <span class="verse">5</span> To be partial to the faces of the wicked is not good,  nor to deprive the innocent of justice.  <span class="verse">6</span> A fool’s lips come into strife,  and his mouth invites beatings.  <span class="verse">7</span> A fool’s mouth is his destruction,  and his lips are a snare to his soul.  <span class="verse">8</span> The words of a gossip are like dainty morsels:  they go down into a person’s innermost parts.  <span class="verse">9</span> One who is slack in his work  is brother to him who is a master of destruction.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh’s name is a strong tower:  the righteous run to him, and are safe.  <span class="verse">11</span> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,  like an unscalable wall in his own imagination.  <span class="verse">12</span> Before destruction the heart of man is proud,  but before honor is humility.

Today I have become your father?” and again,  “I will be to him a Father,  and he will be to me a Son?” <span class="verse">6</span> When he again brings in the firstborn into the world he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.” <span class="verse">7</span> Of the angels he says,  “He makes his angels winds,  and his servants a flame of fire.” <span class="verse">8</span> But of the Son he says,  “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.  The scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom.  <span class="verse">9</span> You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity;  therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.”
