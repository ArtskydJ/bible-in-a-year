		<span class="reference">Isaiah 21-23</span>  <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> The burden of the wilderness of the sea.  As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from an awesome land.   <span class="verse">2</span> A grievous vision is declared to me. The treacherous man deals treacherously, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, Elam; attack! I have stopped all of Media’s sighing.   <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish. Pains have seized me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am in so much pain that I can’t hear. I so am dismayed that I can’t see.   <span class="verse">4</span> My heart flutters. Horror has frightened me. The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.   <span class="verse">5</span> They prepare the table. They set the watch. They eat. They drink. Rise up, you princes, oil the shield!   <span class="verse">6</span> For the Lord said to me, “Go, set a watchman. Let him declare what he sees.   <span class="verse">7</span> When he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.”   <span class="verse">8</span> He cried like a lion: “Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and every night I stay at my post.   <span class="verse">9</span> Behold, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs.” He answered, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.  <span class="verse">10</span> You are my threshing, and the grain of my floor!” That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, I have declared to you.  <span class="verse">11</span> The burden of Dumah.  One calls to me out of Seir, “Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?”   <span class="verse">12</span> The watchman said, “The morning comes, and also the night. If you will inquire, inquire. Come back again.”  <span class="verse">13</span> The burden on Arabia.  In the forest in Arabia you will lodge, you caravans of Dedanites.   <span class="verse">14</span> They brought water to him who was thirsty. The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.   <span class="verse">15</span> For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.   <span class="verse">16</span> For the Lord said to me, “Within a year, as a worker bound by contract would count it, all the glory of Kedar will fail,   <span class="verse">17</span> and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.”   <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">1</span> The burden of the valley of vision.  What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?   <span class="verse">2</span> You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.   <span class="verse">3</span> All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away.   <span class="verse">4</span> Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.  <span class="verse">5</span> For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.”   <span class="verse">6</span> Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.   <span class="verse">7</span> Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.   <span class="verse">8</span> He took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.   <span class="verse">9</span> You saw the breaches of David’s city, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.   <span class="verse">10</span> You counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.   <span class="verse">11</span> You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn’t look to him who had done this, neither did you have respect for him who planed it long ago.  <span class="verse">12</span> In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth;   <span class="verse">13</span> and behold, joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.”   <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, “Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">15</span> The Lord, Yahweh of Armies says, “Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, and say,   <span class="verse">16</span> ‘What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?’ Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!”   <span class="verse">17</span> Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly.   <span class="verse">18</span> He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame of your lord’s house.   <span class="verse">19</span> I will thrust you from your office. You will be pulled down from your station.  <span class="verse">20</span> It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,   <span class="verse">21</span> and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.   <span class="verse">22</span> I will lay the key of David’s house on his shoulder. He will open, and no one will shut. He will shut, and no one will open.   <span class="verse">23</span> I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place. He will be for a throne of glory to his father’s house.   <span class="verse">24</span> They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.   <span class="verse">25</span> “In that day,” says Yahweh of Armies, “the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way. It will be cut down and fall. The burden that was on it will be cut off, for Yahweh has spoken it.”   <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> The burden of Tyre.  Howl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.   <span class="verse">2</span> Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon that pass over the sea, have replenished.   <span class="verse">3</span> On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue. She was the market of nations.   <span class="verse">4</span> Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not travailed, nor given birth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.”   <span class="verse">5</span> When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.   <span class="verse">6</span> Pass over to Tarshish! Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!   <span class="verse">7</span> Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far away to travel?  <span class="verse">8</span> Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are the honorable of the earth?   <span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.   <span class="verse">10</span> Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no restraint any more.   <span class="verse">11</span> He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan’s strongholds.   <span class="verse">12</span> He said, “You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people didn’t exist. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin.   <span class="verse">14</span> Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!   <span class="verse">15</span> It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute.   <span class="verse">16</span> Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered.   <span class="verse">17</span> It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre. She will return to her wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth.   <span class="verse">18</span> Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

Apply your heart to my teaching.  <span class="verse">18</span> For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them within you,  if all of them are ready on your lips.  <span class="verse">19</span>  I teach you today, even you,  So that your trust may be in Yahweh.  <span class="verse">20</span> Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent things  of counsel and knowledge,  <span class="verse">21</span> To teach you truth, reliable words,  to give sound answers to the ones who sent you?  <span class="verse">22</span> Don’t exploit the poor, because he is poor;  and don’t crush the needy in court;  <span class="verse">23</span> for Yahweh will plead their case,  and plunder the life of those who plunder them.  <span class="verse">24</span> Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man,  and don’t associate with one who harbors anger:  <span class="verse">25</span> lest you learn his ways,  and ensnare your soul.  <span class="verse">26</span> Don’t you be one of those who strike hands,  of those who are collateral for debts.  <span class="verse">27</span> If you don’t have means to pay,  why should he take away your bed from under you?  <span class="verse">28</span> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone  which your fathers have set up.  <span class="verse">29</span> Do you see a man skilled in his work?  He will serve kings.  He won’t serve obscure men.

You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.” <span class="verse">33</span> He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”  <span class="verse">34</span> He said,  “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.” <span class="verse">35</span> He said to them,  “When I sent you out without purse, wallet, and sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.”  <span class="verse">36</span> Then he said to them,  “But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.  <span class="verse">37</span> For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’ For that which concerns me has an end.” <span class="verse">38</span> They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.”  He said to them,  “That is enough.”

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 6:1-12</span>  <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ, let’s press on to perfection—not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,   <span class="verse">2</span> of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.   <span class="verse">3</span> This will we do, if God permits.   <span class="verse">4</span> For concerning those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit,   <span class="verse">5</span> and tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come,   <span class="verse">6</span> and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for themselves again, and put him to open shame.   <span class="verse">7</span> For the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it and produces a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receives blessing from God;   <span class="verse">8</span> but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.  <span class="verse">9</span> But, beloved, we are persuaded of better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though we speak like this.   <span class="verse">10</span> For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do serve them.   <span class="verse">11</span> We desire that each one of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the end,   <span class="verse">12</span> that you won’t be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherited the promises.
