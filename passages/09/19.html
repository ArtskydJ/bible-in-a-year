		<span class="reference">Isaiah 42-43</span>  <span class="chapter">42</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Behold, my servant, whom I uphold,  my chosen, in whom my soul delights:  I have put my Spirit on him.  He will bring justice to the nations.  <span class="verse">2</span> He will not shout,  nor raise his voice,  nor cause it to be heard in the street.  <span class="verse">3</span> He won’t break a bruised reed.  He won’t quench a dimly burning wick.  He will faithfully bring justice.  <span class="verse">4</span> He will not fail nor be discouraged,  until he has set justice in the earth,  and the islands wait for his law.”  <span class="verse">5</span> God Yahweh,  he who created the heavens and stretched them out,  he who spread out the earth and that which comes out of it,  he who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk in it, says:  <span class="verse">6</span> “I, Yahweh, have called you in righteousness.  I will hold your hand.  I will keep you,  and make you a covenant for the people,  as a light for the nations,  <span class="verse">7</span> to open the blind eyes,  to bring the prisoners out of the dungeon,  and those who sit in darkness out of the prison.  <span class="verse">8</span> “I am Yahweh.  That is my name.  I will not give my glory to another,  nor my praise to engraved images.  <span class="verse">9</span> Behold, the former things have happened  and I declare new things.  I tell you about them before they come up.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Sing to Yahweh a new song,  and his praise from the end of the earth,  you who go down to the sea,  and all that is therein,  the islands and their inhabitants.  <span class="verse">11</span> Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices,  with the villages that Kedar inhabits.  Let the inhabitants of Sela sing.  Let them shout from the top of the mountains!  <span class="verse">12</span> Let them give glory to Yahweh,  and declare his praise in the islands.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh will go out like a mighty man.  He will stir up zeal like a man of war.  He will raise a war cry.  Yes, he will shout aloud.  He will triumph over his enemies.  <span class="verse">14</span> “I have been silent a long time.  I have been quiet and restrained myself.  Now I will cry out like a travailing woman. I will both gasp and pant.  <span class="verse">15</span> I will destroy mountains and hills,  and dry up all their herbs.  I will make the rivers islands,  and will dry up the pools.  <span class="verse">16</span> I will bring the blind by a way that they don’t know.  I will lead them in paths that they don’t know.  I will make darkness light before them,  and crooked places straight.  I will do these things,  and I will not forsake them.  <span class="verse">17</span> “Those who trust in engraved images,  who tell molten images,  ‘You are our gods,’  will be turned back.  They will be utterly disappointed.  <span class="verse">18</span> “Hear, you deaf,  and look, you blind,  that you may see.  <span class="verse">19</span> Who is blind, but my servant?  Or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send?  Who is as blind as he who is at peace,  and as blind as Yahweh’s servant?  <span class="verse">20</span> You see many things, but don’t observe.  His ears are open, but he doesn’t listen.  <span class="verse">21</span> It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law  and make it honorable.  <span class="verse">22</span> But this is a robbed and plundered people.  All of them are snared in holes,  and they are hidden in prisons.  They have become captives, and no one delivers,  and a plunder, and no one says, ‘Restore them!’  <span class="verse">23</span> Who is there among you who will give ear to this?  Who will listen and hear for the time to come?  <span class="verse">24</span> Who gave Jacob as plunder,  and Israel to the robbers?  Didn’t Yahweh, he against whom we have sinned?  For they would not walk in his ways,  and they disobeyed his law.  <span class="verse">25</span> Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him,  and the strength of battle.  It set him on fire all around, but he didn’t know.  It burned him, but he didn’t take it to heart.”   <span class="chapter">43</span><span class="verse">1</span> But now Yahweh who created you, Jacob,  and he who formed you, Israel, says:  “Don’t be afraid, for I have redeemed you.  I have called you by your name.  You are mine.  <span class="verse">2</span> When you pass through the waters, I will be with you,  and through the rivers, they will not overflow you.  When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned,  and flame will not scorch you.  <span class="verse">3</span> For I am Yahweh your God,  the Holy One of Israel,  your Savior.  I have given Egypt as your ransom,  Ethiopia and Seba in your place.  <span class="verse">4</span> Since you have been precious and honored in my sight,  and I have loved you,  therefore I will give people in your place,  and nations instead of your life.  <span class="verse">5</span> Don’t be afraid, for I am with you.  I will bring your offspring from the east,  and gather you from the west.  <span class="verse">6</span> I will tell the north, ‘Give them up!’  and tell the south, ‘Don’t hold them back!  Bring my sons from far away,  and my daughters from the ends of the earth—  <span class="verse">7</span> everyone who is called by my name,  and whom I have created for my glory,  whom I have formed,  yes, whom I have made.’ ”  <span class="verse">8</span> Bring out the blind people who have eyes,  and the deaf who have ears.  <span class="verse">9</span> Let all the nations be gathered together,  and let the peoples be assembled.  Who among them can declare this,  and show us former things?  Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified,  or let them hear, and say, “That is true.”  <span class="verse">10</span> “You are my witnesses,” says Yahweh,  “With my servant whom I have chosen;  that you may know and believe me,  and understand that I am he.  Before me there was no God formed,  neither will there be after me.  <span class="verse">11</span> I myself am Yahweh.  Besides me, there is no savior.  <span class="verse">12</span> I have declared, I have saved, and I have shown,  and there was no strange god among you.  Therefore you are my witnesses”,  says Yahweh, “and I am God.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yes, since the day was, I am he.  There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.  I will work, and who can hinder it?”  <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says: “For your sake, I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring all of them down as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.   <span class="verse">15</span> I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh, who makes a way in the sea,  and a path in the mighty waters,  <span class="verse">17</span> who brings out the chariot and horse,  the army and the mighty man  (they lie down together, they shall not rise;  they are extinct, they are quenched like a wick) says:  <span class="verse">18</span> “Don’t remember the former things,  and don’t consider the things of old.  <span class="verse">19</span> Behold, I will do a new thing.  It springs out now.  Don’t you know it?  I will even make a way in the wilderness,  and rivers in the desert.  <span class="verse">20</span> The animals of the field, the jackals and the ostriches, shall honor me,  because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert,  to give drink to my people, my chosen,  <span class="verse">21</span> the people which I formed for myself,  that they might declare my praise.  <span class="verse">22</span> Yet you have not called on me, Jacob;  but you have been weary of me, Israel.  <span class="verse">23</span> You have not brought me any of your sheep for burnt offerings,  neither have you honored me with your sacrifices.  I have not burdened you with offerings,  nor wearied you with frankincense.  <span class="verse">24</span> You have bought me no sweet cane with money,  nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices,  but you have burdened me with your sins.  You have wearied me with your iniquities.  <span class="verse">25</span> I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake;  and I will not remember your sins.  <span class="verse">26</span> Put me in remembrance.  Let us plead together.  Declare your case,  that you may be justified.  <span class="verse">27</span> Your first father sinned,  and your teachers have transgressed against me.  <span class="verse">28</span> Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;  and I will make Jacob a curse,  and Israel an insult.”

Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.  <span class="verse">21</span> As coals are to hot embers,  and wood to fire,  so is a contentious man to kindling strife.  <span class="verse">22</span> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,  they go down into the innermost parts.  <span class="verse">23</span> Like silver dross on an earthen vessel  are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.  <span class="verse">24</span> A malicious man disguises himself with his lips,  but he harbors evil in his heart.  <span class="verse">25</span> When his speech is charming, don’t believe him,  for there are seven abominations in his heart.  <span class="verse">26</span> His malice may be concealed by deception,  but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.  <span class="verse">27</span> Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.  Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.  <span class="verse">28</span> A lying tongue hates those it hurts;  and a flattering mouth works ruin.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 9:22-28</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">22</span> According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.  <span class="verse">23</span> It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.   <span class="verse">24</span> For Christ hasn’t entered into holy places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;   <span class="verse">25</span> nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,   <span class="verse">26</span> or else he must have suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.   <span class="verse">27</span> Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment,   <span class="verse">28</span> so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are eagerly waiting for him for salvation.
