		<span class="reference">Isaiah 4-5</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> Seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, “We will eat our own bread, and wear our own clothing. Just let us be called by your name. Take away our reproach.”  <span class="verse">2</span> In that day, Yahweh’s branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel.   <span class="verse">3</span> It will happen that he who is left in Zion and he who remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem,   <span class="verse">4</span> when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from within it, by the spirit of justice and by the spirit of burning.   <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, for over all the glory will be a canopy.   <span class="verse">6</span> There will be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.   <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.  My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.  <span class="verse">2</span> He dug it up,  gathered out its stones,  planted it with the choicest vine,  built a tower in the middle of it,  and also cut out a wine press in it.  He looked for it to yield grapes,  but it yielded wild grapes.  <span class="verse">3</span> “Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,  please judge between me and my vineyard.  <span class="verse">4</span> What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?  Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?  <span class="verse">5</span> Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.  I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.  I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down.  <span class="verse">6</span> I will lay it a wasteland.  It won’t be pruned or hoed,  but it will grow briers and thorns.  I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”  <span class="verse">7</span> For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,  and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:  and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression;  for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.  <span class="verse">8</span> Woe to those who join house to house,  who lay field to field, until there is no room,  and you are made to dwell alone in the middle of the land!  <span class="verse">9</span> In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says: “Surely many houses will be desolate,  even great and beautiful, unoccupied.  <span class="verse">10</span> For ten acres  of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer  of seed shall yield an ephah.” <span class="verse">11</span> Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink,  who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!  <span class="verse">12</span> The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;  but they don’t respect the work of Yahweh,  neither have they considered the operation of his hands.  <span class="verse">13</span> Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.  Their honorable men are famished,  and their multitudes are parched with thirst.  <span class="verse">14</span> Therefore Sheol  has enlarged its desire,  and opened its mouth without measure;  and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.  <span class="verse">15</span> So man is brought low,  mankind is humbled,  and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;  <span class="verse">16</span> but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice,  and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.  <span class="verse">17</span> Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,  and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.  <span class="verse">18</span> Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,  and wickedness as with cart rope,  <span class="verse">19</span> who say, “Let him make haste, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;  let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,  that we may know it!”  <span class="verse">20</span> Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;  who put darkness for light,  and light for darkness;  who put bitter for sweet,  and sweet for bitter!  <span class="verse">21</span> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,  and prudent in their own sight!  <span class="verse">22</span> Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,  and champions at mixing strong drink;  <span class="verse">23</span> who acquit the guilty for a bribe,  but deny justice for the innocent!  <span class="verse">24</span> Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,  and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame,  so their root shall be as rottenness,  and their blossom shall go up as dust,  because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,  and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse">25</span> Therefore Yahweh’s anger burns against his people,  and he has stretched out his hand against them and has struck them.  The mountains tremble,  and their dead bodies are as refuse in the middle of the streets.  For all this, his anger is not turned away,  but his hand is still stretched out.  <span class="verse">26</span> He will lift up a banner to the nations from far away,  and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.  Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.  <span class="verse">27</span> No one shall be weary nor stumble among them;  no one shall slumber nor sleep,  neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,  nor the strap of their sandals be broken,  <span class="verse">28</span> whose arrows are sharp,  and all their bows bent.  Their horses’ hoofs will be like flint,  and their wheels like a whirlwind.  <span class="verse">29</span> Their roaring will be like a lioness.  They will roar like young lions.  Yes, they shall roar,  and seize their prey and carry it off,  and there will be no one to deliver.  <span class="verse">30</span> They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea.  If one looks to the land, behold, darkness and distress.  The light is darkened in its clouds.

He who pours out lies shall not go free.  <span class="verse">6</span> Many will entreat the favor of a ruler,  and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.  <span class="verse">7</span> All the relatives of the poor shun him:  how much more do his friends avoid him!  He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.  <span class="verse">8</span> He who gets wisdom loves his own soul.  He who keeps understanding shall find good.  <span class="verse">9</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished.  He who utters lies shall perish.  <span class="verse">10</span> Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool,  much less for a servant to have rule over princes.  <span class="verse">11</span> The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger.  It is his glory to overlook an offense.  <span class="verse">12</span> The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion,  but his favor is like dew on the grass.  <span class="verse">13</span> A foolish son is the calamity of his father.  A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping.  <span class="verse">14</span> House and riches are an inheritance from fathers,  but a prudent wife is from Yahweh.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 2:1-9</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Therefore we ought to pay greater attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.   <span class="verse">2</span> For if the word spoken through angels proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,   <span class="verse">3</span> how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation—which at the first having been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard,   <span class="verse">4</span> God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, by various works of power and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to his own will?  <span class="verse">5</span> For he didn’t subject the world to come, of which we speak, to angels.   <span class="verse">6</span> But one has somewhere testified, saying,  “What is man, that you think of him?  Or the son of man, that you care for him?  <span class="verse">7</span> You made him a little lower than the angels.  You crowned him with glory and honor. <span class="verse">8</span> You have put all things in subjection under his feet.” For in that he subjected all things to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don’t see all things subjected to him, yet.   <span class="verse">9</span> But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.
