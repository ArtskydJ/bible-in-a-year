		<span class="reference">Isaiah 59-61</span>  <span class="chapter">59</span><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, Yahweh’s hand is not shortened, that it can’t save;  nor his ear dull, that it can’t hear.  <span class="verse">2</span> But your iniquities have separated you and your God,  and your sins have hidden his face from you,  so that he will not hear.  <span class="verse">3</span> For your hands are defiled with blood,  and your fingers with iniquity.  Your lips have spoken lies.  Your tongue mutters wickedness.  <span class="verse">4</span> No one sues in righteousness,  and no one pleads in truth.  They trust in vanity,  and speak lies.  They conceive mischief,  and give birth to iniquity.  <span class="verse">5</span> They hatch adders’ eggs,  and weave the spider’s web.  He who eats of their eggs dies;  and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.  <span class="verse">6</span> Their webs won’t become garments.  They won’t cover themselves with their works.  Their works are works of iniquity,  and acts of violence are in their hands.  <span class="verse">7</span> Their feet run to evil,  and they hurry to shed innocent blood.  Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity.  Desolation and destruction are in their paths.  <span class="verse">8</span> They don’t know the way of peace;  and there is no justice in their ways.  They have made crooked paths for themselves;  whoever goes in them doesn’t know peace.  <span class="verse">9</span> Therefore justice is far from us,  and righteousness doesn’t overtake us.  We look for light, but see darkness;  for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.  <span class="verse">10</span> We grope for the wall like the blind.  Yes, we grope as those who have no eyes.  We stumble at noon as if it were twilight.  Among those who are strong, we are like dead men.  <span class="verse">11</span> We all roar like bears  and moan bitterly like doves.  We look for justice, but there is none,  for salvation, but it is far off from us.  <span class="verse">12</span> For our transgressions are multiplied before you,  and our sins testify against us;  for our transgressions are with us,  and as for our iniquities, we know them:  <span class="verse">13</span> transgressing and denying Yahweh,  and turning away from following our God,  speaking oppression and revolt,  conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.  <span class="verse">14</span> Justice is turned away backward,  and righteousness stands far away;  for truth has fallen in the street,  and uprightness can’t enter.  <span class="verse">15</span> Yes, truth is lacking;  and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey.  Yahweh saw it,  and it displeased him that there was no justice.  <span class="verse">16</span> He saw that there was no man,  and wondered that there was no intercessor.  Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;  and his righteousness sustained him.  <span class="verse">17</span> He put on righteousness as a breastplate,  and a helmet of salvation on his head.  He put on garments of vengeance for clothing,  and was clad with zeal as a mantle.  <span class="verse">18</span> According to their deeds,  he will repay as appropriate,  wrath to his adversaries,  recompense to his enemies;  he will repay the islands their due.  <span class="verse">19</span> So they will fear Yahweh’s name from the west,  and his glory from the rising of the sun;  for he will come as a rushing stream,  which Yahweh’s breath drives.  <span class="verse">20</span> “A Redeemer will come to Zion,  and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">21</span> “As for me, this is my covenant with them,” says Yahweh. “My Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your offspring, nor out of the mouth of your offspring’s offspring,” says Yahweh, “from now on and forever.”   <span class="chapter">60</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Arise, shine; for your light has come,  and Yahweh’s glory has risen on you.  <span class="verse">2</span> For, behold, darkness will cover the earth,  and thick darkness the peoples;  but Yahweh will arise on you,  and his glory shall be seen on you.  <span class="verse">3</span> Nations will come to your light,  and kings to the brightness of your rising.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Lift up your eyes all around, and see:  they all gather themselves together.  They come to you.  Your sons will come from far away,  and your daughters will be carried in arms.  <span class="verse">5</span> Then you shall see and be radiant,  and your heart will thrill and be enlarged;  because the abundance of the sea will be turned to you.  The wealth of the nations will come to you.  <span class="verse">6</span> A multitude of camels will cover you,  the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah.  All from Sheba will come.  They will bring gold and frankincense,  and will proclaim the praises of Yahweh.  <span class="verse">7</span> All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered together to you.  The rams of Nebaioth will serve you.  They will be accepted as offerings on my altar;  and I will beautify my glorious house.  <span class="verse">8</span> “Who are these who fly as a cloud,  and as the doves to their windows?  <span class="verse">9</span> Surely the islands will wait for me,  and the ships of Tarshish first,  to bring your sons from far,  their silver and their gold with them,  for the name of Yahweh your God,  and for the Holy One of Israel,  because he has glorified you.  <span class="verse">10</span> “Foreigners will build up your walls,  and their kings will serve you:  for in my wrath I struck you,  but in my favor I have had mercy on you.  <span class="verse">11</span> Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night, that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations, and their kings led captive.  <span class="verse">12</span> For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish; yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.  <span class="verse">13</span> “The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the cypress tree, the pine, and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.  <span class="verse">14</span> The sons of those who afflicted you will come bowing to you;  and all those who despised you will bow themselves down at the soles of your feet.  They will call you Yahweh’s City,  the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.  <span class="verse">15</span> “Whereas you have been forsaken and hated,  so that no one passed through you,  I will make you an eternal excellency,  a joy of many generations.  <span class="verse">16</span> You will also drink the milk of the nations,  and will nurse from royal breasts.  Then you will know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior,  your Redeemer,  the Mighty One of Jacob.  <span class="verse">17</span> For bronze I will bring gold;  for iron I will bring silver;  for wood, bronze,  and for stones, iron.  I will also make peace your governor,  and righteousness your ruler.  <span class="verse">18</span> Violence shall no more be heard in your land,  nor desolation or destruction within your borders;  but you will call your walls Salvation,  and your gates Praise.  <span class="verse">19</span> The sun will be no more your light by day;  nor will the brightness of the moon give light to you,  but Yahweh will be your everlasting light,  and your God will be your glory.  <span class="verse">20</span> Your sun will not go down any more,  nor will your moon withdraw itself;  for Yahweh will be your everlasting light,  and the days of your mourning will end.  <span class="verse">21</span> Then your people will all be righteous.  They will inherit the land forever,  the branch of my planting,  the work of my hands,  that I may be glorified.  <span class="verse">22</span> The little one will become a thousand,  and the small one a strong nation.  I, Yahweh, will do this quickly in its time.”   <span class="chapter">61</span><span class="verse">1</span> The Lord Yahweh’s Spirit is on me,  because Yahweh has anointed me to preach good news to the humble.  He has sent me to bind up the broken hearted,  to proclaim liberty to the captives  and release to those who are bound,  <span class="verse">2</span> to proclaim the year of Yahweh’s favor  and the day of vengeance of our God,  to comfort all who mourn,  <span class="verse">3</span> to provide for those who mourn in Zion,  to give to them a garland for ashes,  the oil of joy for mourning,  the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness,  that they may be called trees of righteousness,  the planting of Yahweh,  that he may be glorified.  <span class="verse">4</span> They will rebuild the old ruins.  They will raise up the former devastated places.  They will repair the ruined cities  that have been devastated for many generations.  <span class="verse">5</span> Strangers will stand and feed your flocks.  Foreigners will work your fields and your vineyards.  <span class="verse">6</span> But you will be called Yahweh’s priests.  Men will call you the servants of our God.  You will eat the wealth of the nations.  You will boast in their glory.  <span class="verse">7</span> Instead of your shame you will have double.  Instead of dishonor, they will rejoice in their portion.  Therefore in their land they will possess double.  Everlasting joy will be to them.  <span class="verse">8</span> “For I, Yahweh, love justice.  I hate robbery and iniquity.  I will give them their reward in truth  and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.  <span class="verse">9</span> Their offspring will be known among the nations,  and their offspring among the peoples.  All who see them will acknowledge them,  that they are the offspring which Yahweh has blessed.”  <span class="verse">10</span> I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh!  My soul will be joyful in my God,  for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation.  He has covered me with the robe of righteousness,  as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland  and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.  <span class="verse">11</span> For as the earth produces its bud,  and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring up,  so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all the nations.

Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.   <span class="verse">22</span> Also, certain women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb;   <span class="verse">23</span> and when they didn’t find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.   <span class="verse">24</span> Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”  <span class="verse">25</span> He said to them,  “Foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!  <span class="verse">26</span> Didn’t the Christ have to suffer these things and to enter into his glory?” <span class="verse">27</span> Beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 12:1-13</span>  <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Therefore let’s also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let’s run with perseverance the race that is set before us,   <span class="verse">2</span> looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.   <span class="verse">3</span> For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don’t grow weary, fainting in your souls.   <span class="verse">4</span> You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin.   <span class="verse">5</span> You have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children,  “My son, don’t take lightly the chastening of the Lord,  nor faint when you are reproved by him;  <span class="verse">6</span> for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines,  and chastises every son whom he receives.” <span class="verse">7</span> It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn’t discipline?   <span class="verse">8</span> But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then you are illegitimate, and not children.   <span class="verse">9</span> Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?   <span class="verse">10</span> For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.   <span class="verse">11</span> All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.   <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,  <span class="verse">13</span> and make straight paths for your feet,  so what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.
