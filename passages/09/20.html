		<span class="reference">Isaiah 44</span>  <span class="chapter">44</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yet listen now, Jacob my servant,  and Israel, whom I have chosen.  <span class="verse">2</span> This is what Yahweh who made you,  and formed you from the womb,  who will help you says:  “Don’t be afraid, Jacob my servant;  and you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.  <span class="verse">3</span> For I will pour water on him who is thirsty,  and streams on the dry ground.  I will pour my Spirit on your descendants,  and my blessing on your offspring:  <span class="verse">4</span> and they will spring up among the grass,  as willows by the watercourses.  <span class="verse">5</span> One will say, ‘I am Yahweh’s;’  and another will be called by the name of Jacob;  and another will write with his hand ‘to Yahweh,’  and honor the name of Israel.”  <span class="verse">6</span> This is what Yahweh, the King of Israel,  and his Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies, says:  “I am the first, and I am the last;  and besides me there is no God.  <span class="verse">7</span> Who is like me?  Who will call,  and will declare it,  and set it in order for me,  since I established the ancient people?  Let them declare the things that are coming,  and that will happen.  <span class="verse">8</span> Don’t fear,  neither be afraid.  Haven’t I declared it to you long ago,  and shown it?  You are my witnesses.  Is there a God besides me?  Indeed, there is not.  I don’t know any other Rock.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Everyone who makes a carved image is vain.  The things that they delight in will not profit.  Their own witnesses don’t see, nor know, that they may be disappointed.  <span class="verse">10</span> Who has fashioned a god,  or molds an image that is profitable for nothing?  <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, all his fellows will be disappointed;  and the workmen are mere men.  Let them all be gathered together.  Let them stand up.  They will fear.  They will be put to shame together.  <span class="verse">12</span> The blacksmith takes an ax,  works in the coals,  fashions it with hammers,  and works it with his strong arm.  He is hungry,  and his strength fails;  he drinks no water,  and is faint.  <span class="verse">13</span> The carpenter stretches out a line.  He marks it out with a pencil.  He shapes it with planes.  He marks it out with compasses,  and shapes it like the figure of a man,  with the beauty of a man,  to reside in a house.  <span class="verse">14</span> He cuts down cedars for himself,  and takes the cypress and the oak,  and strengthens for himself one among the trees of the forest.  He plants a cypress tree,  and the rain nourishes it.  <span class="verse">15</span> Then it will be for a man to burn;  and he takes some of it, and warms himself.  Yes, he burns it, and bakes bread.  Yes, he makes a god, and worships it;  he makes it a carved image, and falls down to it.  <span class="verse">16</span> He burns part of it in the fire.  With part of it, he eats meat.  He roasts a roast, and is satisfied.  Yes, he warms himself,  and says, “Aha! I am warm. I have seen the fire.”  <span class="verse">17</span> The rest of it he makes into a god,  even his engraved image.  He bows down to it and worships,  and prays to it, and says, “Deliver me; for you are my god!”  <span class="verse">18</span> They don’t know, neither do they consider:  for he has shut their eyes, that they can’t see;  and their hearts, that they can’t understand.  <span class="verse">19</span> No one thinks,  neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say,  “I have burned part of it in the fire.  Yes, I have also baked bread on its coals.  I have roasted meat and eaten it.  Shall I make the rest of it into an abomination?  Shall I bow down to a tree trunk?”  <span class="verse">20</span> He feeds on ashes.  A deceived heart has turned him aside;  and he can’t deliver his soul,  nor say, “Isn’t there a lie in my right hand?”  <span class="verse">21</span> Remember these things, Jacob and Israel;  for you are my servant.  I have formed you.  You are my servant.  Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.  <span class="verse">22</span> I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions,  and, as a cloud, your sins.  Return to me, for I have redeemed you.  <span class="verse">23</span> Sing, you heavens, for Yahweh has done it!  Shout, you lower parts of the earth!  Break out into singing, you mountains, O forest, all of your trees,  for Yahweh has redeemed Jacob,  and will glorify himself in Israel.  <span class="verse">24</span> Yahweh, your Redeemer,  and he who formed you from the womb says:  “I am Yahweh, who makes all things;  who alone stretches out the heavens;  who spreads out the earth by myself;  <span class="verse">25</span> who frustrates the signs of the liars,  and makes diviners mad;  who turns wise men backward,  and makes their knowledge foolish;  <span class="verse">26</span> who confirms the word of his servant,  and performs the counsel of his messengers;  who says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be inhabited;’  and of the cities of Judah, ‘They will be built,’  and ‘I will raise up its waste places;’  <span class="verse">27</span> who says to the deep, ‘Be dry,’  and ‘I will dry up your rivers;’  <span class="verse">28</span> Who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure,’  even saying of Jerusalem, ‘She will be built;’  and of the temple, ‘Your foundation will be laid.’ ”

Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.  A neighbor who is near is better than a distant brother.  <span class="verse">11</span> Be wise, my son,  and bring joy to my heart,  then I can answer my tormentor.  <span class="verse">12</span> A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;  but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.  <span class="verse">13</span> Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger.  Hold it for a wayward woman!  <span class="verse">14</span> He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,  it will be taken as a curse by him.

The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”  <span class="verse">36</span> The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,   <span class="verse">37</span> and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 10:1-18</span>  <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> For the law, having a shadow of the good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect those who draw near.   <span class="verse">2</span> Or else wouldn’t they have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins?   <span class="verse">3</span> But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins.   <span class="verse">4</span> For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.   <span class="verse">5</span> Therefore when he comes into the world, he says,  “You didn’t desire sacrifice and offering,  but you prepared a body for me.  <span class="verse">6</span> You had no pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin.  <span class="verse">7</span> Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come (in the scroll of the book it is written of me)  to do your will, O God.’ ” <span class="verse">8</span> Previously saying, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you didn’t desire, neither had pleasure in them” (those which are offered according to the law),   <span class="verse">9</span> then he has said, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,   <span class="verse">10</span> by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   <span class="verse">11</span> Every priest indeed stands day by day serving and often offering the same sacrifices which can never take away sins,   <span class="verse">12</span> but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God,   <span class="verse">13</span> from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.   <span class="verse">14</span> For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.   <span class="verse">15</span> The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,  <span class="verse">16</span> “This is the covenant that I will make with them:  ‘After those days,’ says the Lord,  ‘I will put my laws on their heart,  I will also write them on their mind;’ ” then he says,  <span class="verse">17</span> “I will remember their sins and their iniquities no more.” <span class="verse">18</span> Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
