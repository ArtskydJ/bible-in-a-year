		<span class="reference">Isaiah 65</span>  <span class="chapter">65</span><span class="verse">1</span> “I am inquired of by those who didn’t ask.  I am found by those who didn’t seek me.  I said, ‘See me, see me,’ to a nation that was not called by my name.  <span class="verse">2</span> I have spread out my hands all day to a rebellious people,  who walk in a way that is not good,  after their own thoughts;  <span class="verse">3</span> a people who provoke me to my face continually,  sacrificing in gardens,  and burning incense on bricks;  <span class="verse">4</span> who sit among the graves,  and spend nights in secret places;  who eat pig’s meat,  and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;  <span class="verse">5</span> who say, ‘Stay by yourself,  don’t come near to me,  for I am holier than you.’  These are smoke in my nose,  a fire that burns all day.  <span class="verse">6</span> “Behold, it is written before me:  I will not keep silence,  but will repay,  yes, I will repay into their bosom,  <span class="verse">7</span> your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together”, says Yahweh,  “who have burned incense on the mountains,  and blasphemed me on the hills.  Therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh says,  “As the new wine is found in the cluster,  and one says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:’  so I will do for my servants’ sake,  that I may not destroy them all.  <span class="verse">9</span> I will bring offspring out of Jacob,  and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains.  My chosen will inherit it,  and my servants will dwell there.  <span class="verse">10</span> Sharon will be a fold of flocks,  and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in,  for my people who have sought me.  <span class="verse">11</span> “But you who forsake Yahweh,  who forget my holy mountain,  who prepare a table for Fortune,  and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;  <span class="verse">12</span> I will destine you to the sword,  and you will all bow down to the slaughter;  because when I called, you didn’t answer.  When I spoke, you didn’t listen;  but you did that which was evil in my eyes,  and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Therefore the Lord Yahweh says,  “Behold, my servants will eat,  but you will be hungry;  behold, my servants will drink,  but you will be thirsty.  Behold, my servants will rejoice,  but you will be disappointed;  <span class="verse">14</span> Behold, my servants will sing for joy of heart,  but you will cry for sorrow of heart,  and will wail for anguish of spirit.  <span class="verse">15</span> You will leave your name for a curse to my chosen;  and the Lord Yahweh will kill you.  He will call his servants by another name,  <span class="verse">16</span> so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth;  and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth;  because the former troubles are forgotten,  and because they are hidden from my eyes.  <span class="verse">17</span> “For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;  and the former things will not be remembered,  nor come into mind.  <span class="verse">18</span> But be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;  for, behold, I create Jerusalem to be a delight,  and her people a joy.  <span class="verse">19</span> I will rejoice in Jerusalem,  and delight in my people;  and the voice of weeping and the voice of crying  will be heard in her no more.  <span class="verse">20</span> “No more will there be an infant who only lives a few days,  nor an old man who has not filled his days;  for the child will die one hundred years old,  and the sinner being one hundred years old will be accursed.  <span class="verse">21</span> They will build houses and inhabit them.  They will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.  <span class="verse">22</span> They will not build and another inhabit.  They will not plant and another eat:  for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,  and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.  <span class="verse">23</span> They will not labor in vain  nor give birth for calamity;  for they are the offspring of Yahweh’s blessed  and their descendants with them.  <span class="verse">24</span> It will happen that before they call, I will answer;  and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.  <span class="verse">25</span> The wolf and the lamb will feed together.  The lion will eat straw like the ox.  Dust will be the serpent’s food.  They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,”  says Yahweh.

Oh, son of my womb!

Why do doubts arise in your hearts?  <span class="verse">39</span> See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.” <span class="verse">40</span> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.   <span class="verse">41</span> While they still didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them,  “Do you have anything here to eat?” <span class="verse">42</span> They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.   <span class="verse">43</span> He took them, and ate in front of them.   <span class="verse">44</span> He said to them,  “This is what I told you, while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled.”
