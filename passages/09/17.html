		<span class="reference">Isaiah 38-39</span>  <span class="chapter">38</span><span class="verse">1</span> In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death. Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him, and said to him, “Yahweh says, ‘Set your house in order, for you will die, and not live.’ ”  <span class="verse">2</span> Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,   <span class="verse">3</span> and said, “Remember now, Yahweh, I beg you, how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in your sight.” Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.  <span class="verse">4</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Isaiah, saying,   <span class="verse">5</span> “Go, and tell Hezekiah, ‘Yahweh, the God of David your father, says, “I have heard your prayer. I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life.   <span class="verse">6</span> I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.   <span class="verse">7</span> This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken.   <span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I will cause the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.” ’ ” So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.  <span class="verse">9</span> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered of his sickness.  <span class="verse">10</span> I said, “In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol. I am deprived of the residue of my years.”  <span class="verse">11</span> I said, “I won’t see Yah,  Yah in the land of the living.  I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.  <span class="verse">12</span> My dwelling is removed,  and is carried away from me like a shepherd’s tent.  I have rolled up my life like a weaver.  He will cut me off from the loom.  From day even to night you will make an end of me.  <span class="verse">13</span> I waited patiently until morning.  He breaks all my bones like a lion.  From day even to night you will make an end of me.  <span class="verse">14</span> I chattered like a swallow or a crane.  I moaned like a dove.  My eyes weaken looking upward.  Lord, I am oppressed.  Be my security.”  <span class="verse">15</span> What will I say?  He has both spoken to me, and himself has done it.  I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul.  <span class="verse">16</span> Lord, men live by these things;  and my spirit finds life in all of them:  you restore me, and cause me to live.  <span class="verse">17</span> Behold, for peace I had great anguish,  but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;  for you have cast all my sins behind your back.  <span class="verse">18</span> For Sheol  can’t praise you.  Death can’t celebrate you.  Those who go down into the pit can’t hope for your truth.  <span class="verse">19</span> The living, the living, he shall praise you, as I do today.  The father shall make known your truth to the children.  <span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh will save me.  Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in Yahweh’s house.  <span class="verse">21</span> Now Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.”   <span class="verse">22</span> Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I will go up to Yahweh’s house?”   <span class="chapter">39</span><span class="verse">1</span> At that time, Merodach Baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah; for he heard that he had been sick, and had recovered.   <span class="verse">2</span> Hezekiah was pleased with them, and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil, and all the house of his armor, and all that was found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah didn’t show them.   <span class="verse">3</span> Then Isaiah the prophet came to king Hezekiah, and asked him, “What did these men say? From where did they come to you?”  Hezekiah said, “They have come from a country far from me, even from Babylon.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Then he asked, “What have they seen in your house?”  Hezekiah answered, “They have seen all that is in my house. There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:   <span class="verse">6</span> ‘Behold, the days are coming when all that is in your house, and that which your fathers have stored up until today, will be carried to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">7</span> ‘They will take away your sons who will issue from you, whom you shall father, and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon’s palace.’ ”  <span class="verse">8</span> Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “Yahweh’s word which you have spoken is good.” He said moreover, “For there will be peace and truth in my days.”

A soft tongue breaks the bone.  <span class="verse">16</span> Have you found honey?  Eat as much as is sufficient for you,  lest you eat too much, and vomit it.  <span class="verse">17</span> Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor’s house,  lest he be weary of you, and hate you.  <span class="verse">18</span> A man who gives false testimony against his neighbor  is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.  <span class="verse">19</span> Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of trouble  is like a bad tooth or a lame foot.  <span class="verse">20</span> As one who takes away a garment in cold weather,  or vinegar on soda,  so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.  <span class="verse">21</span> If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat.  If he is thirsty, give him water to drink;  <span class="verse">22</span> for you will heap coals of fire on his head,  and Yahweh will reward you.  <span class="verse">23</span> The north wind produces rain;  so a backbiting tongue brings an angry face.  <span class="verse">24</span> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop  than to share a house with a contentious woman.  <span class="verse">25</span> Like cold water to a thirsty soul,  so is good news from a far country.  <span class="verse">26</span> Like a muddied spring and a polluted well,  so is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked.  <span class="verse">27</span> It is not good to eat much honey,  nor is it honorable to seek one’s own honor.  <span class="verse">28</span> Like a city that is broken down and without walls  is a man whose spirit is without restraint.

Release to us Barabbas!”—   <span class="verse">19</span> one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 9:1-10</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now indeed even the first  covenant had ordinances of divine service and an earthly sanctuary.   <span class="verse">2</span> For a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lamp stand, the table, and the show bread; which is called the Holy Place.   <span class="verse">3</span> After the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,   <span class="verse">4</span> having a golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant;   <span class="verse">5</span> and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat, of which things we can’t speak now in detail.   <span class="verse">6</span> Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,   <span class="verse">7</span> but into the second the high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.   <span class="verse">8</span> The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the way into the Holy Place wasn’t yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing.   <span class="verse">9</span> This is a symbol of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshiper perfect,   <span class="verse">10</span> being only (with meats and drinks and various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of reformation.
