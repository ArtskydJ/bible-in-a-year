		<span class="reference">Isaiah 51-53</span>  <span class="chapter">51</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Listen to me, you who follow after righteousness,  you who seek Yahweh.  Look to the rock you were cut from,  and to the quarry you were dug from.  <span class="verse">2</span> Look to Abraham your father,  and to Sarah who bore you;  for when he was but one I called him,  I blessed him,  and made him many.  <span class="verse">3</span> For Yahweh has comforted Zion.  He has comforted all her waste places,  and has made her wilderness like Eden,  and her desert like the garden of Yahweh.  Joy and gladness will be found in them,  thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Listen to me, my people;  and hear me, my nation,  for a law will go out from me,  and I will establish my justice for a light to the peoples.  <span class="verse">5</span> My righteousness is near.  My salvation has gone out,  and my arms will judge the peoples.  The islands will wait for me,  and they will trust my arm.  <span class="verse">6</span> Lift up your eyes to the heavens,  and look at the earth beneath;  for the heavens will vanish away like smoke,  and the earth will wear out like a garment.  Its inhabitants will die in the same way,  but my salvation will be forever,  and my righteousness will not be abolished.  <span class="verse">7</span> “Listen to me, you who know righteousness,  the people in whose heart is my law.  Don’t fear the reproach of men,  and don’t be dismayed at their insults.  <span class="verse">8</span> For the moth will eat them up like a garment,  and the worm will eat them like wool;  but my righteousness will be forever,  and my salvation to all generations.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Awake, awake, put on strength, arm of Yahweh!  Awake, as in the days of old,  the generations of ancient times.  Isn’t it you who cut Rahab in pieces,  who pierced the monster?  <span class="verse">10</span> Isn’t it you who dried up the sea,  the waters of the great deep;  who made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?  <span class="verse">11</span> Those ransomed by Yahweh will return,  and come with singing to Zion.  Everlasting joy shall be on their heads.  They will obtain gladness and joy.  Sorrow and sighing shall flee away.  <span class="verse">12</span> “I, even I, am he who comforts you.  Who are you, that you are afraid of man who shall die,  and of the son of man who will be made as grass?  <span class="verse">13</span> Have you forgotten Yahweh your Maker,  who stretched out the heavens,  and laid the foundations of the earth?  Do you live in fear continually all day because of the fury of the oppressor,  when he prepares to destroy?  Where is the fury of the oppressor?  <span class="verse">14</span> The captive exile will speedily be freed.  He will not die and go down into the pit.  His bread won’t fail.  <span class="verse">15</span> For I am Yahweh your God, who stirs up the sea  so that its waves roar.  Yahweh of Armies is his name.  <span class="verse">16</span> I have put my words in your mouth  and have covered you in the shadow of my hand,  that I may plant the heavens,  and lay the foundations of the earth,  and tell Zion, ‘You are my people.’ ”  <span class="verse">17</span> Awake, awake!  Stand up, Jerusalem,  you who have drunk from Yahweh’s hand the cup of his wrath.  You have drunken the bowl of the cup of staggering,  and drained it.  <span class="verse">18</span> There is no one to guide her among all the sons to whom she has given birth;  and there is no one who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up.  <span class="verse">19</span> These two things have happened to you—  who will grieve with you?—  desolation and destruction,  and famine and the sword.  How can I comfort you?  <span class="verse">20</span> Your sons have fainted.  They lie at the head of all the streets,  like an antelope in a net.  They are full of Yahweh’s wrath,  the rebuke of your God.  <span class="verse">21</span> Therefore now hear this, you afflicted,  and drunken, but not with wine:  <span class="verse">22</span> Your Lord Yahweh,  your God who pleads the cause of his people, says,  “Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering,  even the bowl of the cup of my wrath.  You will not drink it any more.  <span class="verse">23</span> I will put it into the hand of those who afflict you,  who have said to your soul, ‘Bow down, that we may walk over you;’  and you have laid your back as the ground,  like a street to those who walk over.”   <span class="chapter">52</span><span class="verse">1</span> Awake, awake! Put on your strength, Zion.  Put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city:  for from now on the uncircumcised and the unclean will no more come into you.  <span class="verse">2</span> Shake yourself from the dust!  Arise, sit up, Jerusalem!  Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!  <span class="verse">3</span> For Yahweh says, “You were sold for nothing;  and you will be redeemed without money.”  <span class="verse">4</span> For the Lord Yahweh says:  “My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there:  and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.  <span class="verse">5</span> “Now therefore, what do I do here,” says Yahweh,  “seeing that my people are taken away for nothing?  Those who rule over them mock,” says Yahweh,  “and my name is blasphemed continually all day long.  <span class="verse">6</span> Therefore my people shall know my name.  Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks.  Behold, it is I.”  <span class="verse">7</span> How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news,  who publishes peace,  who brings good news,  who proclaims salvation,  who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”  <span class="verse">8</span> Your watchmen lift up their voice.  Together they sing;  for they shall see eye to eye when Yahweh returns to Zion.  <span class="verse">9</span> Break out into joy!  Sing together, you waste places of Jerusalem;  for Yahweh has comforted his people.  He has redeemed Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh has made his holy arm bare in the eyes of all the nations.  All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.  <span class="verse">11</span> Depart! Depart! Go out from there! Touch no unclean thing!  Go out from among her!  Cleanse yourselves, you who carry Yahweh’s vessels.  <span class="verse">12</span> For you shall not go out in haste,  neither shall you go by flight:  for Yahweh will go before you;  and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.  <span class="verse">13</span> Behold, my servant will deal wisely.  He will be exalted and lifted up,  and will be very high.  <span class="verse">14</span> Just as many were astonished at you—  his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men—  <span class="verse">15</span> so he will cleanse  many nations.  Kings will shut their mouths at him;  for they will see that which had not been told them,  and they will understand that which they had not heard.   <span class="chapter">53</span><span class="verse">1</span> Who has believed our message?  To whom has Yahweh’s arm been revealed?  <span class="verse">2</span> For he grew up before him as a tender plant,  and as a root out of dry ground.  He has no good looks or majesty.  When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.  <span class="verse">3</span> He was despised  and rejected by men,  a man of suffering  and acquainted with disease.  He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;  and we didn’t respect him.  <span class="verse">4</span> Surely he has borne our sickness  and carried our suffering;  yet we considered him plagued,  struck by God, and afflicted.  <span class="verse">5</span> But he was pierced for our transgressions.  He was crushed for our iniquities.  The punishment that brought our peace was on him;  and by his wounds we are healed.  <span class="verse">6</span> All we like sheep have gone astray.  Everyone has turned to his own way;  and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.  <span class="verse">7</span> He was oppressed,  yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth.  As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,  and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent,  so he didn’t open his mouth.  <span class="verse">8</span> He was taken away by oppression and judgment.  As for his generation,  who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living  and stricken for the disobedience of my people?  <span class="verse">9</span> They made his grave with the wicked,  and with a rich man in his death,  although he had done no violence,  nor was any deceit in his mouth.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.  He has caused him to suffer.  When you make his soul an offering for sin,  he will see his offspring.  He will prolong his days  and Yahweh’s pleasure will prosper in his hand.  <span class="verse">11</span> After the suffering of his soul,  he will see the light  and be satisfied.  My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;  and he will bear their iniquities.  <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore I will give him a portion with the great.  He will divide the plunder with the strong;  because he poured out his soul to death  and was counted with the transgressors;  yet he bore the sins of many  and made intercession for the transgressors.

The wicked aren’t concerned about knowledge.  <span class="verse">8</span> Mockers stir up a city,  but wise men turn away anger.  <span class="verse">9</span> If a wise man goes to court with a foolish man,  the fool rages or scoffs, and there is no peace.  <span class="verse">10</span> The bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity;  and they seek the life of the upright.  <span class="verse">11</span> A fool vents all of his anger,  but a wise man brings himself under control.  <span class="verse">12</span> If a ruler listens to lies,  all of his officials are wicked.  <span class="verse">13</span> The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:  Yahweh gives sight to the eyes of both.  <span class="verse">14</span> The king who fairly judges the poor,  his throne shall be established forever.

They said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?   <span class="verse">6</span> He isn’t here, but is risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee,   <span class="verse">7</span> saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again?”

He went out, not knowing where he went.   <span class="verse">9</span> By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise.   <span class="verse">10</span> For he looked for the city which has the foundations, whose builder and maker is God.   <span class="verse">11</span> By faith, even Sarah herself received power to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised.   <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore, were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead.   <span class="verse">13</span> These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen  them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.   <span class="verse">14</span> For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.   <span class="verse">15</span> If indeed they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had enough time to return.   <span class="verse">16</span> But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
