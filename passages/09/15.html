		<span class="reference">Isaiah 34-36</span>  <span class="chapter">34</span><span class="verse">1</span> Come near, you nations, to hear!  Listen, you peoples.  Let the earth and all it contains hear,  the world, and everything that comes from it.  <span class="verse">2</span> For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations,  and angry with all their armies.  He has utterly destroyed them.  He has given them over for slaughter.  <span class="verse">3</span> Their slain will also be cast out,  and the stench of their dead bodies will come up.  The mountains will melt in their blood.  <span class="verse">4</span> All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.  The sky will be rolled up like a scroll,  and all its armies will fade away,  as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.  <span class="verse">5</span> For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky.  Behold, it will come down on Edom,  and on the people of my curse, for judgment.  <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh’s sword is filled with blood.  It is covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats,  with the fat of the kidneys of rams;  for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah,  And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.  <span class="verse">7</span> The wild oxen will come down with them,  and the young bulls with the mighty bulls;  and their land will be drunken with blood,  and their dust made greasy with fat.  <span class="verse">8</span> For Yahweh has a day of vengeance,  a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.  <span class="verse">9</span> Its streams will be turned into pitch,  its dust into sulfur,  And its land will become burning pitch.  <span class="verse">10</span> It won’t be quenched night nor day.  Its smoke will go up forever.  From generation to generation, it will lie waste.  No one will pass through it forever and ever.  <span class="verse">11</span> But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.  The owl and the raven will dwell in it.  He will stretch the line of confusion over it,  and the plumb line of emptiness.  <span class="verse">12</span> They shall call its nobles to the kingdom, but none shall be there;  and all its princes shall be nothing.  <span class="verse">13</span> Thorns will come up in its palaces,  nettles and thistles in its fortresses;  and it will be a habitation of jackals,  a court for ostriches.  <span class="verse">14</span> The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves,  and the wild goat will cry to his fellow.  Yes, the night creature  shall settle there,  and shall find herself a place of rest.  <span class="verse">15</span> The arrow snake will make her nest there,  and lay, hatch, and gather under her shade.  Yes, the kites will be gathered there, every one with her mate.  <span class="verse">16</span> Search in the book of Yahweh, and read:  not one of these will be missing.  None will lack her mate.  For my mouth has commanded,  and his Spirit has gathered them.  <span class="verse">17</span> He has cast the lot for them,  and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line.  They shall possess it forever.  From generation to generation they will dwell in it.   <span class="chapter">35</span><span class="verse">1</span> The wilderness and the dry land will be glad.  The desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.  <span class="verse">2</span> It will blossom abundantly,  and rejoice even with joy and singing.  Lebanon’s glory will be given to it,  the excellence of Carmel and Sharon.  They will see Yahweh’s glory,  the excellence of our God.  <span class="verse">3</span> Strengthen the weak hands,  and make the feeble knees firm.  <span class="verse">4</span> Tell those who have a fearful heart, “Be strong!  Don’t be afraid!  Behold, your God will come with vengeance, God’s retribution.  He will come and save you.  <span class="verse">5</span> Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,  and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.  <span class="verse">6</span> Then the lame man will leap like a deer,  and the tongue of the mute will sing;  for waters will break out in the wilderness,  and streams in the desert.  <span class="verse">7</span> The burning sand will become a pool,  and the thirsty ground springs of water.  Grass with reeds and rushes will be in the habitation of jackals, where they lay.  <span class="verse">8</span> A highway will be there, a road,  and it will be called “The Holy Way”.  The unclean shall not pass over it,  but it will be for those who walk in the Way.  Wicked fools shall not go there.  <span class="verse">9</span> No lion will be there,  nor will any ravenous animal go up on it.  They will not be found there;  but the redeemed will walk there.  <span class="verse">10</span> Then Yahweh’s ransomed ones will return,  and come with singing to Zion;  and everlasting joy will be on their heads.  They will obtain gladness and joy,  and sorrow and sighing will flee away.”   <span class="chapter">36</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.   <span class="verse">2</span> The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a large army. He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller’s field highway.   <span class="verse">3</span> Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder came out to him.  <span class="verse">4</span> Rabshakeh said to them, “Now tell Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says, “What confidence is this in which you trust?   <span class="verse">5</span> I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?   <span class="verse">6</span> Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.   <span class="verse">7</span> But if you tell me, ‘We trust in Yahweh our God,’ isn’t that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar?’ ”   <span class="verse">8</span> Now therefore, please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.   <span class="verse">9</span> How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?   <span class="verse">10</span> Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up against this land, and destroy it.” ’ ”  <span class="verse">11</span> Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Don’t speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”  <span class="verse">12</span> But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”   <span class="verse">13</span> Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!   <span class="verse">14</span> The king says, ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you; for he will not be able to deliver you.   <span class="verse">15</span> Don’t let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely deliver us. This city won’t be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” ’   <span class="verse">16</span> Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says, ‘Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;   <span class="verse">17</span> until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.   <span class="verse">18</span> Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “Yahweh will deliver us.” Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?   <span class="verse">19</span> Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?   <span class="verse">20</span> Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’ ”  <span class="verse">21</span> But they remained silent, and said nothing in reply, for the king’s commandment was, “Don’t answer him.”  <span class="verse">22</span> Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

To show partiality in judgment is not good.  <span class="verse">24</span> He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”  peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him—  <span class="verse">25</span> but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,  and a rich blessing will come on them.  <span class="verse">26</span> An honest answer  is like a kiss on the lips.  <span class="verse">27</span> Prepare your work outside,  and get your fields ready.  Afterwards, build your house.  <span class="verse">28</span> Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause.  Don’t deceive with your lips.  <span class="verse">29</span> Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;  I will repay the man according to his work.”  <span class="verse">30</span> I went by the field of the sluggard,  by the vineyard of the man void of understanding:  <span class="verse">31</span> Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.  Its surface was covered with nettles,  and its stone wall was broken down.  <span class="verse">32</span> Then I saw, and considered well.  I saw, and received instruction:  <span class="verse">33</span> a little sleep, a little slumber,  a little folding of the hands to sleep,  <span class="verse">34</span> so your poverty will come as a robber  and your want as an armed man.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 8:1-6</span>  <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,   <span class="verse">2</span> a servant of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.   <span class="verse">3</span> For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.   <span class="verse">4</span> For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law,   <span class="verse">5</span> who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.” <span class="verse">6</span> But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.
