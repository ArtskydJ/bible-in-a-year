		<span class="reference">Isaiah 14</span>  <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> For Yahweh will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land. The foreigner will join himself with them, and they will unite with the house of Jacob.   <span class="verse">2</span> The peoples will take them, and bring them to their place. The house of Israel will possess them in Yahweh’s land for servants and for handmaids. They will take as captives those whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.  <span class="verse">3</span> It will happen in the day that Yahweh will give you rest from your sorrow, from your trouble, and from the hard service in which you were made to serve,   <span class="verse">4</span> that you will take up this parable against the king of Babylon, and say, “How the oppressor has ceased! The golden city has ceased!”   <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers,   <span class="verse">6</span> who struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, who ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that no one restrained.   <span class="verse">7</span> The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet. They break out in song.   <span class="verse">8</span> Yes, the cypress trees rejoice with you, with the cedars of Lebanon, saying, “Since you are humbled, no lumberjack has come up against us.”   <span class="verse">9</span> Sheol  from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming. It stirs up the departed spirits for you, even all the rulers of the earth. It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.   <span class="verse">10</span> They all will answer and ask you, “Have you also become as weak as we are? Have you become like us?”   <span class="verse">11</span> Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,  with the sound of your stringed instruments. Maggots are spread out under you, and worms cover you.  <span class="verse">12</span> How you have fallen from heaven, shining one, son of the dawn! How you are cut down to the ground, who laid the nations low!   <span class="verse">13</span> You said in your heart, “I will ascend into heaven! I will exalt my throne above the stars of God! I will sit on the mountain of assembly, in the far north!   <span class="verse">14</span> I will ascend above the heights of the clouds! I will make myself like the Most High!”   <span class="verse">15</span> Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol,  to the depths of the pit.   <span class="verse">16</span> Those who see you will stare at you. They will ponder you, saying, “Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, who shook kingdoms,   <span class="verse">17</span> who made the world like a wilderness, and overthrew its cities, who didn’t release his prisoners to their home?”  <span class="verse">18</span> All the kings of the nations, sleep in glory, everyone in his own house.   <span class="verse">19</span> But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, who go down to the stones of the pit; like a dead body trodden under foot.   <span class="verse">20</span> You will not join them in burial, because you have destroyed your land. You have killed your people. The offspring of evildoers will not be named forever.  <span class="verse">21</span> Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers, that they not rise up and possess the earth, and fill the surface of the world with cities.   <span class="verse">22</span> “I will rise up against them,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son’s son,” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">23</span> “I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water. I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">24</span> Yahweh of Armies has sworn, saying, “Surely, as I have thought, so shall it happen; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand:   <span class="verse">25</span> that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and tread him under foot on my mountains. Then his yoke will leave them, and his burden leave their shoulders.   <span class="verse">26</span> This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth. This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.   <span class="verse">27</span> For Yahweh of Armies has planned, and who can stop it? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?”  <span class="verse">28</span> This burden was in the year that king Ahaz died.  <span class="verse">29</span> Don’t rejoice, O Philistia, all of you, because the rod that struck you is broken; for out of the serpent’s root an adder will emerge, and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.   <span class="verse">30</span> The firstborn of the poor will eat, and the needy will lie down in safety; and I will kill your root with famine, and your remnant will be killed.  <span class="verse">31</span> Howl, gate! Cry, city! You are melted away, Philistia, all of you; for smoke comes out of the north, and there is no straggler in his ranks.  <span class="verse">32</span> What will they answer the messengers of the nation? That Yahweh has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his people will take refuge.

		<span class="reference">Proverbs 21:1-16</span>  <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> The king’s heart is in Yahweh’s hand like the watercourses.  He turns it wherever he desires.  <span class="verse">2</span> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes,  but Yahweh weighs the hearts.  <span class="verse">3</span> To do righteousness and justice  is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.  <span class="verse">4</span> A high look and a proud heart,  the lamp of the wicked, is sin.  <span class="verse">5</span> The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit;  and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.  <span class="verse">6</span> Getting treasures by a lying tongue  is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.  <span class="verse">7</span> The violence of the wicked will drive them away,  because they refuse to do what is right.  <span class="verse">8</span> The way of the guilty is devious,  but the conduct of the innocent is upright.  <span class="verse">9</span> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop  than to share a house with a contentious woman.  <span class="verse">10</span> The soul of the wicked desires evil;  his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.  <span class="verse">11</span> When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom.  When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.  <span class="verse">12</span> The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked,  and brings the wicked to ruin.  <span class="verse">13</span> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor,  he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.  <span class="verse">14</span> A gift in secret pacifies anger,  and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.  <span class="verse">15</span> It is joy to the righteous to do justice;  but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.  <span class="verse">16</span> The man who wanders out of the way of understanding  shall rest in the assembly of the departed spirits.

		<span class="reference">Luke 22:7-13</span>  <span class="chapter">22</span><span class="verse">7</span> The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.   <span class="verse">8</span> Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,  “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.” <span class="verse">9</span> They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”  <span class="verse">10</span> He said to them,  “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.  <span class="verse">11</span> Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’  <span class="verse">12</span> He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.” <span class="verse">13</span> They went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 4:1-11</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> Let’s fear therefore, lest perhaps anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering into his rest.   <span class="verse">2</span> For indeed we have had good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with faith by those who heard.   <span class="verse">3</span> For we who have believed do enter into that rest, even as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, they will not enter into my rest;”  although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.   <span class="verse">4</span> For he has said this somewhere about the seventh day, “God rested on the seventh day from all his works;” <span class="verse">5</span> and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.” <span class="verse">6</span> Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it, and they to whom the good news was preached before failed to enter in because of disobedience,   <span class="verse">7</span> he again defines a certain day, today, saying through David so long a time afterward (just as has been said),  “Today if you will hear his voice,  don’t harden your hearts.” <span class="verse">8</span> For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.   <span class="verse">9</span> There remains therefore a Sabbath rest for the people of God.   <span class="verse">10</span> For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.   <span class="verse">11</span> Let’s therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
