		<span class="reference">Isaiah 18-20</span>  <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;   <span class="verse">2</span> that sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus on the waters, saying, “Go, you swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide!”   <span class="verse">3</span> All you inhabitants of the world, and you dwellers on the earth, when a banner is lifted up on the mountains, look! When the trumpet is blown, listen!  <span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh said to me, “I will be still, and I will see in my dwelling place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”   <span class="verse">5</span> For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches.   <span class="verse">6</span> They will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains, and for the animals of the earth. The ravenous birds will eat them in the summer, and all the animals of the earth will eat them in the winter.   <span class="verse">7</span> In that time, a present will be brought to Yahweh of Armies from a people tall and smooth, even from a people awesome from their beginning onward, a nation that measures out and treads down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of Yahweh of Armies, Mount Zion.   <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">1</span> The burden of Egypt.  “Behold, Yahweh rides on a swift cloud, and comes to Egypt. The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt will melt within it.   <span class="verse">2</span> I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they will fight everyone against his brother, and everyone against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.   <span class="verse">3</span> The spirit of Egypt will fail within it. I will destroy its counsel. They will seek the idols, the charmers, those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards.   <span class="verse">4</span> I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord. A fierce king will rule over them,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">5</span> The waters will fail from the sea, and the river will be wasted and become dry.   <span class="verse">6</span> The rivers will become foul. The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up. The reeds and flags will wither away.   <span class="verse">7</span> The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.   <span class="verse">8</span> The fishermen will lament, and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn, and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.   <span class="verse">9</span> Moreover those who work in combed flax, and those who weave white cloth, will be confounded.   <span class="verse">10</span> The pillars will be broken in pieces. All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.  <span class="verse">11</span> The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish. The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid. How do you say to Pharaoh, “I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?”   <span class="verse">12</span> Where then are your wise men? Let them tell you now; and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.   <span class="verse">13</span> The princes of Zoan have become fools. The princes of Memphis are deceived. They have caused Egypt to go astray, who are the cornerstone of her tribes.   <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works, like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.   <span class="verse">15</span> Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which head or tail, palm branch or rush, may do.   <span class="verse">16</span> In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of Yahweh of Armies’s hand, which he shakes over them.   <span class="verse">17</span> The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt. Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid, because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies, which he determines against it.   <span class="verse">18</span> In that day, there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Yahweh of Armies. One will be called “The city of destruction.”  <span class="verse">19</span> In that day, there will be an altar to Yahweh in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.   <span class="verse">20</span> It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors, and he will send them a savior and a defender, and he will deliver them.   <span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day. Yes, they will worship with sacrifice and offering, and will vow a vow to Yahweh, and will perform it.   <span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh will strike Egypt, striking and healing. They will return to Yahweh, and he will be entreated by them, and will heal them.  <span class="verse">23</span> In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.  <span class="verse">24</span> In that day, Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing within the earth;   <span class="verse">25</span> because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.”   <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him, and he fought against Ashdod and took it;   <span class="verse">2</span> at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist, and take your sandals from off your feet.” He did so, walking naked and barefoot.   <span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh said, “As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia,   <span class="verse">4</span> so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia, young and old, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.   <span class="verse">5</span> They will be dismayed and confounded, because of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.   <span class="verse">6</span> The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is our expectation, where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria. And we, how will we escape?’ ”

The borrower is servant to the lender.  <span class="verse">8</span> He who sows wickedness reaps trouble,  and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.  <span class="verse">9</span> He who has a generous eye will be blessed;  for he shares his food with the poor.  <span class="verse">10</span> Drive out the mocker, and strife will go out;  yes, quarrels and insults will stop.  <span class="verse">11</span> He who loves purity of heart and speaks gracefully  is the king’s friend.  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh’s eyes watch over knowledge;  but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful.  <span class="verse">13</span> The sluggard says, “There is a lion outside!  I will be killed in the streets!”  <span class="verse">14</span> The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit.  He who is under Yahweh’s wrath will fall into it.  <span class="verse">15</span> Folly is bound up in the heart of a child:  the rod of discipline drives it far from him.  <span class="verse">16</span> Whoever oppresses the poor for his own increase and whoever gives to the rich,  both come to poverty.

But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.  <span class="verse">27</span> For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.  <span class="verse">28</span> But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.  <span class="verse">29</span> I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,  <span class="verse">30</span> that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 5</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> For every high priest, being taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.   <span class="verse">2</span> The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness.   <span class="verse">3</span> Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.   <span class="verse">4</span> Nobody takes this honor on himself, but he is called by God, just like Aaron was.   <span class="verse">5</span> So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be made a high priest, but it was he who said to him,  “You are my Son.  Today I have become your father.” <span class="verse">6</span> As he says also in another place,  “You are a priest forever,  after the order of Melchizedek.” <span class="verse">7</span> He, in the days of his flesh, having offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear,   <span class="verse">8</span> though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.   <span class="verse">9</span> Having been made perfect, he became to all of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation,   <span class="verse">10</span> named by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.  <span class="verse">11</span> About him we have many words to say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.   <span class="verse">12</span> For although by this time you should be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need milk, and not solid food.   <span class="verse">13</span> For everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a baby.   <span class="verse">14</span> But solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil.
