		<span class="reference">Isaiah 62-64</span>  <span class="chapter">62</span><span class="verse">1</span> For Zion’s sake I will not hold my peace,  and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest,  until her righteousness shines out like the dawn,  and her salvation like a burning lamp.  <span class="verse">2</span> The nations will see your righteousness,  and all kings your glory.  You will be called by a new name,  which Yahweh’s mouth will name.  <span class="verse">3</span> You will also be a crown of beauty in Yahweh‘s hand,  and a royal diadem in your God’s hand.  <span class="verse">4</span> You will not be called Forsaken any more,  nor will your land be called Desolate any more;  but you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you,  and your land will be married.  <span class="verse">5</span> For as a young man marries a virgin,  so your sons will marry you.  As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride,  so your God will rejoice over you.  <span class="verse">6</span> I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem.  They will never be silent day nor night.  You who call on Yahweh, take no rest,  <span class="verse">7</span> and give him no rest, until he establishes,  and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.  <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh has sworn by his right hand,  and by the arm of his strength,  “Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies,  and foreigners will not drink your new wine, for which you have labored,  <span class="verse">9</span> but those who have harvested it will eat it, and praise Yahweh.  Those who have gathered it will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Go through, go through the gates!  Prepare the way of the people!  Build up, build up the highway!  Gather out the stones!  Lift up a banner for the peoples.  <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth,  “Say to the daughter of Zion,  ‘Behold, your salvation comes!  Behold, his reward is with him,  and his recompense before him!’ ”  <span class="verse">12</span> They will call them “The Holy People,  Yahweh’s Redeemed”.  You will be called “Sought Out,  A City Not Forsaken”.   <span class="chapter">63</span><span class="verse">1</span> Who is this who comes from Edom,  with dyed garments from Bozrah?  Who is this who is glorious in his clothing,  marching in the greatness of his strength?  “It is I who speak in righteousness,  mighty to save.”  <span class="verse">2</span> Why is your clothing red,  and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat?  <span class="verse">3</span> “I have trodden the wine press alone.  Of the peoples, no one was with me.  Yes, I trod them in my anger  and trampled them in my wrath.  Their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments,  and I have stained all my clothing.  <span class="verse">4</span> For the day of vengeance was in my heart,  and the year of my redeemed has come.  <span class="verse">5</span> I looked, and there was no one to help;  and I wondered that there was no one to uphold.  Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me.  My own wrath upheld me.  <span class="verse">6</span> I trod down the peoples in my anger  and made them drunk in my wrath.  I poured their lifeblood out on the earth.”  <span class="verse">7</span> I will tell of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh  and the praises of Yahweh,  according to all that Yahweh has given to us,  and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,  which he has given to them according to his mercies,  and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.  <span class="verse">8</span> For he said, “Surely, they are my people,  children who will not deal falsely;”  so he became their Savior.  <span class="verse">9</span> In all their affliction he was afflicted,  and the angel of his presence saved them.  In his love and in his pity he redeemed them.  He bore them,  and carried them all the days of old.  <span class="verse">10</span> But they rebelled  and grieved his Holy Spirit.  Therefore he turned and became their enemy,  and he himself fought against them.  <span class="verse">11</span> Then he remembered the days of old,  Moses and his people, saying,  “Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock?  Where is he who put his Holy Spirit among them?”  <span class="verse">12</span> Who caused his glorious arm to be at Moses’ right hand?  Who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name?  <span class="verse">13</span> Who led them through the depths,  like a horse in the wilderness,  so that they didn’t stumble?  <span class="verse">14</span> As the livestock that go down into the valley,  Yahweh’s Spirit caused them to rest.  So you led your people to make yourself a glorious name.  <span class="verse">15</span> Look down from heaven,  and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory.  Where are your zeal and your mighty acts?  The yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me.  <span class="verse">16</span> For you are our Father,  though Abraham doesn’t know us,  and Israel does not acknowledge us.  You, Yahweh, are our Father.  Our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.  <span class="verse">17</span> O Yahweh, why do you make us wander from your ways,  and harden our heart from your fear?  Return for your servants’ sake,  the tribes of your inheritance.  <span class="verse">18</span> Your holy people possessed it but a little while.  Our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.  <span class="verse">19</span> We have become like those over whom you never ruled,  like those who were not called by your name.   <span class="chapter">64</span><span class="verse">1</span> Oh that you would tear the heavens,  that you would come down,  that the mountains might quake at your presence.  <span class="verse">2</span> As when fire kindles the brushwood,  and the fire causes the water to boil;  Make your name known to your adversaries,  that the nations may tremble at your presence!  <span class="verse">3</span> When you did awesome things which we didn’t look for,  you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence.  <span class="verse">4</span> For from of old men have not heard,  nor perceived by the ear,  nor has the eye seen a God besides you,  who works for him who waits for him.  <span class="verse">5</span> You meet him who rejoices and does righteousness,  those who remember you in your ways.  Behold, you were angry, and we sinned.  We have been in sin for a long time.  Shall we be saved?  <span class="verse">6</span> For we have all become like one who is unclean,  and all our righteousness is like a polluted garment.  We all fade like a leaf;  and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.  <span class="verse">7</span> There is no one who calls on your name,  who stirs himself up to take hold of you;  for you have hidden your face from us,  and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.  <span class="verse">8</span> But now, Yahweh, you are our Father.  We are the clay and you our potter.  We all are the work of your hand.  <span class="verse">9</span> Don’t be furious, Yahweh.  Don’t remember iniquity forever.  Look and see, we beg you,  we are all your people.  <span class="verse">10</span> Your holy cities have become a wilderness.  Zion has become a wilderness,  Jerusalem a desolation.  <span class="verse">11</span> Our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised you  is burned with fire.  All our pleasant places are laid waste.  <span class="verse">12</span> Will you hold yourself back for these things, Yahweh?  Will you keep silent and punish us very severely?

Breaking it, he gave it to them.   <span class="verse">31</span> Their eyes were opened and they recognized him, then he vanished out of their sight.   <span class="verse">32</span> They said to one another, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us, while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?”   <span class="verse">33</span> They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,   <span class="verse">34</span> saying, “The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!”   <span class="verse">35</span> They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 12:14-29</span>  <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">14</span> Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,   <span class="verse">15</span> looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and many be defiled by it,   <span class="verse">16</span> lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, like Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.   <span class="verse">17</span> For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.  <span class="verse">18</span> For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,   <span class="verse">19</span> the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,   <span class="verse">20</span> for they could not stand that which was commanded, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned”. <span class="verse">21</span> So fearful was the appearance that Moses said, “I am terrified and trembling.” <span class="verse">22</span> But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,   <span class="verse">23</span> to the festal gathering and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,   <span class="verse">24</span> to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,  and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.  <span class="verse">25</span> See that you don’t refuse him who speaks. For if they didn’t escape when they refused him who warned on the earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,   <span class="verse">26</span> whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.” <span class="verse">27</span> This phrase, “Yet once more” signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.   <span class="verse">28</span> Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can’t be shaken, let’s have grace, through which we serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,   <span class="verse">29</span> for our God is a consuming fire.
