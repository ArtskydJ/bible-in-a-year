		<span class="reference">Isaiah 2-3</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> This is what Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">2</span> It shall happen in the latter days, that the mountain of Yahweh’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains,  and shall be raised above the hills;  and all nations shall flow to it.  <span class="verse">3</span> Many peoples shall go and say,  “Come, let’s go up to the mountain of Yahweh,  to the house of the God of Jacob;  and he will teach us of his ways,  and we will walk in his paths.”  For the law shall go out of Zion,  and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">4</span> He will judge between the nations,  and will decide concerning many peoples.  They shall beat their swords into plowshares,  and their spears into pruning hooks.  Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,  neither shall they learn war any more.  <span class="verse">5</span> House of Jacob, come, and let’s walk in the light of Yahweh.  <span class="verse">6</span> For you have forsaken your people, the house of Jacob,  because they are filled from the east,  with those who practice divination like the Philistines,  and they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.  <span class="verse">7</span> Their land is full of silver and gold,  neither is there any end of their treasures.  Their land also is full of horses,  neither is there any end of their chariots.  <span class="verse">8</span> Their land also is full of idols.  They worship the work of their own hands,  that which their own fingers have made.  <span class="verse">9</span> Man is brought low,  and mankind is humbled;  therefore don’t forgive them.  <span class="verse">10</span> Enter into the rock,  and hide in the dust,  from before the terror of Yahweh,  and from the glory of his majesty.  <span class="verse">11</span> The lofty looks of man will be brought low,  the arrogance of men will be bowed down,  and Yahweh alone will be exalted in that day.  <span class="verse">12</span> For there will be a day of Yahweh of Armies for all that is proud and arrogant,  and for all that is lifted up;  and it shall be brought low:  <span class="verse">13</span> for all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,  for all the oaks of Bashan,  <span class="verse">14</span> for all the high mountains,  for all the hills that are lifted up,  <span class="verse">15</span> for every lofty tower,  for every fortified wall,  <span class="verse">16</span> for all the ships of Tarshish,  and for all pleasant imagery.  <span class="verse">17</span> The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,  and the arrogance of men shall be brought low;  and Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day.  <span class="verse">18</span> The idols shall utterly pass away.  <span class="verse">19</span> Men shall go into the caves of the rocks,  and into the holes of the earth,  from before the terror of Yahweh,  and from the glory of his majesty,  when he arises to shake the earth mightily.  <span class="verse">20</span> In that day, men shall cast away their idols of silver  and their idols of gold,  which have been made for themselves to worship,  to the moles and to the bats,  <span class="verse">21</span> to go into the caverns of the rocks,  and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,  from before the terror of Yahweh,  and from the glory of his majesty,  when he arises to shake the earth mightily.  <span class="verse">22</span> Stop trusting in man, whose breath is in his nostrils;  for of what account is he?   <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> For, behold,  the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support,  the whole supply of bread,  and the whole supply of water;  <span class="verse">2</span> the mighty man,  the man of war,  the judge,  the prophet,  the diviner,  the elder,  <span class="verse">3</span> the captain of fifty,  the honorable man,  the counselor,  the skilled craftsman,  and the clever enchanter.  <span class="verse">4</span> I will give boys to be their princes,  and children shall rule over them.  <span class="verse">5</span> The people will be oppressed,  everyone by another,  and everyone by his neighbor.  The child will behave himself proudly against the old man,  and the wicked against the honorable.  <span class="verse">6</span> Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,  “You have clothing, you be our ruler,  and let this ruin be under your hand.”  <span class="verse">7</span> In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer;  for in my house is neither bread nor clothing.  You shall not make me ruler of the people.”  <span class="verse">8</span> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen;  because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh,  to provoke the eyes of his glory.  <span class="verse">9</span> The look of their faces testify against them.  They parade their sin like Sodom.  They don’t hide it.  Woe to their soul!  For they have brought disaster upon themselves.  <span class="verse">10</span> Tell the righteous “Good!”  For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.  <span class="verse">11</span> Woe to the wicked!  Disaster is upon them;  for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.  <span class="verse">12</span> As for my people, children are their oppressors,  and women rule over them.  My people, those who lead you cause you to err,  and destroy the way of your paths.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh stands up to contend,  and stands to judge the peoples.  <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people  and their leaders:  “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard.  The plunder of the poor is in your houses.  <span class="verse">15</span> What do you mean that you crush my people,  and grind the face of the poor?” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">16</span> Moreover Yahweh said, “Because the daughters of Zion are arrogant,  and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes,  walking to trip as they go,  jingling ornaments on their feet;  <span class="verse">17</span> therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion,  and Yahweh will make their scalps bald.”  <span class="verse">18</span> In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,   <span class="verse">19</span> the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,   <span class="verse">20</span> the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume containers, the charms,   <span class="verse">21</span> the signet rings, the nose rings,   <span class="verse">22</span> the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,   <span class="verse">23</span> the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.  <span class="verse">24</span> It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness;  instead of a belt, a rope;  instead of well set hair, baldness;  instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth;  and branding instead of beauty.  <span class="verse">25</span> Your men shall fall by the sword,  and your mighty in the war.  <span class="verse">26</span> Her gates shall lament and mourn.  She shall be desolate and sit on the ground.

The ear of the wise seeks knowledge.  <span class="verse">16</span> A man’s gift makes room for him,  and brings him before great men.  <span class="verse">17</span> He who pleads his cause first seems right;  until another comes and questions him.  <span class="verse">18</span> The lot settles disputes,  and keeps strong ones apart.  <span class="verse">19</span> A brother offended is more difficult than a fortified city.  Disputes are like the bars of a fortress.  <span class="verse">20</span> A man’s stomach is filled with the fruit of his mouth.  With the harvest of his lips he is satisfied.  <span class="verse">21</span> Death and life are in the power of the tongue;  those who love it will eat its fruit.  <span class="verse">22</span> Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing,  and obtains favor of Yahweh.  <span class="verse">23</span> The poor plead for mercy,  but the rich answer harshly.  <span class="verse">24</span> A man of many companions may be ruined,  but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.

There will be terrors and great signs from heaven.  <span class="verse">12</span> But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, delivering you up to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors for my name’s sake.  <span class="verse">13</span> It will turn out as a testimony for you.  <span class="verse">14</span> Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate beforehand how to answer,  <span class="verse">15</span> for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to withstand or to contradict.  <span class="verse">16</span> You will be handed over even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends. They will cause some of you to be put to death.  <span class="verse">17</span> You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake.  <span class="verse">18</span> And not a hair of your head will perish. <span class="verse">19</span> “By your endurance you will win your lives.
