		<span class="reference">Isaiah 45-46</span>  <span class="chapter">45</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him, and strip kings of their armor; to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut:  <span class="verse">2</span> “I will go before you  and make the rough places smooth.  I will break the doors of bronze in pieces  and cut apart the bars of iron.  <span class="verse">3</span> I will give you the treasures of darkness  and hidden riches of secret places,  that you may know that it is I, Yahweh, who call you by your name,  even the God of Israel.  <span class="verse">4</span> For Jacob my servant’s sake,  and Israel my chosen,  I have called you by your name.  I have given you a title,  though you have not known me.  <span class="verse">5</span> I am Yahweh, and there is no one else.  Besides me, there is no God.  I will strengthen  you,  though you have not known me,  <span class="verse">6</span> that they may know from the rising of the sun,  and from the west,  that there is no one besides me.  I am Yahweh, and there is no one else.  <span class="verse">7</span> I form the light  and create darkness.  I make peace  and create calamity.  I am Yahweh,  who does all these things.  <span class="verse">8</span> Rain, you heavens, from above,  and let the skies pour down righteousness.  Let the earth open, that it may produce salvation,  and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it.  I, Yahweh, have created it.  <span class="verse">9</span> Woe to him who strives with his Maker—  a clay pot among the clay pots of the earth!  Shall the clay ask him who fashions it, ‘What are you making?’  or your work, ‘He has no hands?’  <span class="verse">10</span> Woe to him who says to a father, ‘What have you become the father of?’  or to a mother, ‘What have you given birth to?’ ”  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel  and his Maker says:  “You ask me about the things that are to come, concerning my sons,  and you command me concerning the work of my hands!  <span class="verse">12</span> I have made the earth, and created man on it.  I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens.  I have commanded all their army.  <span class="verse">13</span> I have raised him up in righteousness,  and I will make all his ways straight.  He shall build my city,  and he shall let my exiles go free,  not for price nor reward,” says Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh says: “The labor of Egypt,  and the merchandise of Ethiopia,  and the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you,  and they will be yours.  They will go after you.  They shall come over in chains.  They will bow down to you.  They will make supplication to you:  ‘Surely God is in you; and there is no one else.  There is no other god.  <span class="verse">15</span> Most certainly you are a God who has hidden yourself,  God of Israel, the Savior.’ ”  <span class="verse">16</span> They will be disappointed,  yes, confounded, all of them.  Those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together.  <span class="verse">17</span> Israel will be saved by Yahweh with an everlasting salvation.  You will not be disappointed nor confounded to ages everlasting.  <span class="verse">18</span> For Yahweh who created the heavens,  the God who formed the earth and made it,  who established it and didn’t create it a waste,  who formed it to be inhabited says:  “I am Yahweh.  There is no other.  <span class="verse">19</span> I have not spoken in secret,  in a place of the land of darkness.  I didn’t say to the offspring of Jacob, ‘Seek me in vain.’  I, Yahweh, speak righteousness.  I declare things that are right.  <span class="verse">20</span> “Assemble yourselves and come.  Draw near together, you who have escaped from the nations.  Those have no knowledge who carry the wood of their engraved image,  and pray to a god that can’t save.  <span class="verse">21</span> Declare and present it.  Yes, let them take counsel together.  Who has shown this from ancient time?  Who has declared it of old?  Haven’t I, Yahweh?  There is no other God besides me, a just God and a Savior.  There is no one besides me.  <span class="verse">22</span> “Look to me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth;  for I am God, and there is no other.  <span class="verse">23</span> I have sworn by myself.  The word has gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and will not be revoked,  that to me every knee shall bow,  every tongue shall take an oath.  <span class="verse">24</span> They will say of me,  ‘There is righteousness and strength only in Yahweh.’ ”  Even to him will men come.  All those who raged against him will be disappointed.  <span class="verse">25</span> All the offspring of Israel will be justified in Yahweh,  and will rejoice!   <span class="chapter">46</span><span class="verse">1</span> Bel bows down.  Nebo stoops.  Their idols are carried by animals,  and on the livestock.  The things that you carried around are heavy loads,  a burden for the weary.  <span class="verse">2</span> They stoop and they bow down together.  They could not deliver the burden,  but they have gone into captivity.  <span class="verse">3</span> “Listen to me, house of Jacob,  and all the remnant of the house of Israel,  that have been carried from their birth,  that have been carried from the womb.  <span class="verse">4</span> Even to old age I am he,  and even to gray hairs I will carry you.  I have made, and I will bear.  Yes, I will carry, and will deliver.  <span class="verse">5</span> “To whom will you compare me, and consider my equal,  and compare me, as if we were the same?  <span class="verse">6</span> Some pour out gold from the bag,  and weigh silver in the balance.  They hire a goldsmith,  and he makes it a god.  They fall down—  yes, they worship.  <span class="verse">7</span> They bear it on their shoulder.  They carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands there.  It cannot move from its place.  Yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer.  It cannot save him out of his trouble.  <span class="verse">8</span> “Remember this, and show yourselves men.  Bring it to mind again, you transgressors.  <span class="verse">9</span> Remember the former things of old:  for I am God, and there is no other.  I am God, and there is none like me.  <span class="verse">10</span> I declare the end from the beginning,  and from ancient times things that are not yet done.  I say: My counsel will stand,  and I will do all that I please.  <span class="verse">11</span> I call a ravenous bird from the east,  the man of my counsel from a far country.  Yes, I have spoken.  I will also bring it to pass.  I have planned.  I will also do it.  <span class="verse">12</span> Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted,  who are far from righteousness!  <span class="verse">13</span> I bring my righteousness near.  It is not far off,  and my salvation will not wait.  I will grant salvation to Zion,  my glory to Israel.

He who looks after his master shall be honored.  <span class="verse">19</span> Like water reflects a face,  so a man’s heart reflects the man.  <span class="verse">20</span> Sheol  and Abaddon are never satisfied;  and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.  <span class="verse">21</span> The crucible is for silver,  and the furnace for gold;  but man is refined by his praise.  <span class="verse">22</span> Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,  yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.  <span class="verse">23</span> Know well the state of your flocks,  and pay attention to your herds:  <span class="verse">24</span> for riches are not forever,  nor does the crown endure to all generations.  <span class="verse">25</span> The hay is removed, and the new growth appears,  the grasses of the hills are gathered in.  <span class="verse">26</span> The lambs are for your clothing,  and the goats are the price of a field.  <span class="verse">27</span> There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food,  for your family’s food,  and for the nourishment of your servant girls.
