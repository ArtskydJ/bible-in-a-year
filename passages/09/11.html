		<span class="reference">Isaiah 24-26</span>  <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> Behold, Yahweh makes the earth empty, makes it waste, turns it upside down, and scatters its inhabitants.   <span class="verse">2</span> It will be as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the creditor, so with the debtor; as with the taker of interest, so with the giver of interest.   <span class="verse">3</span> The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste; for Yahweh has spoken this word.   <span class="verse">4</span> The earth mourns and fades away. The world languishes and fades away. The lofty people of the earth languish.   <span class="verse">5</span> The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants, because they have transgressed the laws, violated the statutes, and broken the everlasting covenant.   <span class="verse">6</span> Therefore the curse has devoured the earth, and those who dwell therein are found guilty. Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men are left.   <span class="verse">7</span> The new wine mourns. The vine languishes. All the merry-hearted sigh.   <span class="verse">8</span> The mirth of tambourines ceases. The sound of those who rejoice ends. The joy of the harp ceases.   <span class="verse">9</span> They will not drink wine with a song. Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.   <span class="verse">10</span> The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in.   <span class="verse">11</span> There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone.   <span class="verse">12</span> The city is left in desolation, and the gate is struck with destruction.   <span class="verse">13</span> For it will be so within the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.  <span class="verse">14</span> These shall lift up their voice. They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh. They cry aloud from the sea.   <span class="verse">15</span> Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east, even the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea!   <span class="verse">16</span> From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs. Glory to the righteous!  But I said, “I pine away! I pine away! woe is me!” The treacherous have dealt treacherously. Yes, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.   <span class="verse">17</span> Fear, the pit, and the snare, are on you who inhabit the earth.   <span class="verse">18</span> It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit; and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth tremble.   <span class="verse">19</span> The earth is utterly broken. The earth is torn apart. The earth is shaken violently.   <span class="verse">20</span> The earth will stagger like a drunken man, and will sway back and forth like a hammock. Its disobedience will be heavy on it, and it will fall and not rise again.  <span class="verse">21</span> It will happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.   <span class="verse">22</span> They will be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in the pit, and will be shut up in the prison; and after many days they will be visited.   <span class="verse">23</span> Then the moon will be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and glory will be before his elders.   <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh, you are my God. I will exalt you! I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and truth.   <span class="verse">2</span> For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It will never be built.   <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.   <span class="verse">4</span> For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall.   <span class="verse">5</span> As the heat in a dry place you will bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.  <span class="verse">6</span> In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of choice meat,  a feast of choice wines, of choice meat full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.   <span class="verse">7</span> He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.   <span class="verse">8</span> He has swallowed up death forever! The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces. He will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth, for Yahweh has spoken it.  <span class="verse">9</span> It shall be said in that day, “Behold, this is our God! We have waited for him, and he will save us! This is Yahweh! We have waited for him. We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation!”   <span class="verse">10</span> For Yahweh’s hand will rest in this mountain.  Moab will be trodden down in his place, even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.   <span class="verse">11</span> He will spread out his hands in the middle of it, like one who swims spreads out hands to swim, but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands.   <span class="verse">12</span> He has brought the high fortress of your walls down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.   <span class="chapter">26</span><span class="verse">1</span> In that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah:  “We have a strong city.  God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.  <span class="verse">2</span> Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter:  the one which keeps faith.  <span class="verse">3</span> You will keep whoever’s mind is steadfast in perfect peace,  because he trusts in you.  <span class="verse">4</span> Trust in Yahweh forever;  for in Yah, Yahweh, is an everlasting Rock.  <span class="verse">5</span> For he has brought down those who dwell on high, the lofty city.  He lays it low.  He lays it low even to the ground.  He brings it even to the dust.  <span class="verse">6</span> The foot shall tread it down,  even the feet of the poor  and the steps of the needy.”  <span class="verse">7</span> The way of the just is uprightness.  You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.  <span class="verse">8</span> Yes, in the way of your judgments, Yahweh, we have waited for you.  Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.  <span class="verse">9</span> With my soul I have desired you in the night.  Yes, with my spirit within me I will seek you earnestly;  for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.  <span class="verse">10</span> Let favor be shown to the wicked,  yet he will not learn righteousness.  In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,  and will not see Yahweh’s majesty.  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh, your hand is lifted up, yet they don’t see;  but they will see your zeal for the people, and be disappointed.  Yes, fire will consume your adversaries.  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh, you will ordain peace for us,  for you have also done all our work for us.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh our God, other lords besides you have had dominion over us,  but we will only acknowledge your name.  <span class="verse">14</span> The dead shall not live.  The departed spirits shall not rise.  Therefore you have visited and destroyed them,  and caused all memory of them to perish.  <span class="verse">15</span> You have increased the nation, O Yahweh.  You have increased the nation!  You are glorified!  You have enlarged all the borders of the land.  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh, in trouble they have visited you.  They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.  <span class="verse">17</span> Just as a woman with child, who draws near the time of her delivery,  is in pain and cries out in her pangs,  so we have been before you, Yahweh.  <span class="verse">18</span> We have been with child.  We have been in pain.  We gave birth, it seems, only to wind.  We have not worked any deliverance in the earth;  neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.  <span class="verse">19</span> Your dead shall live.  My dead bodies shall arise.  Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust;  for your dew is like the dew of herbs,  and the earth will cast out the departed spirits.  <span class="verse">20</span> Come, my people, enter into your rooms,  and shut your doors behind you.  Hide yourself for a little moment,  until the indignation is past.  <span class="verse">21</span> For, behold, Yahweh comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.  The earth also will disclose her blood, and will no longer cover her slain.

In your wisdom, show restraint.  <span class="verse">5</span> Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?  For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.  <span class="verse">6</span> Don’t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,  and don’t crave his delicacies:  <span class="verse">7</span> for as he thinks about the cost, so he is.  “Eat and drink!” he says to you,  but his heart is not with you.  <span class="verse">8</span> The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up,  and lose your good words.  <span class="verse">9</span> Don’t speak in the ears of a fool,  for he will despise the wisdom of your words.  <span class="verse">10</span> Don’t move the ancient boundary stone.  Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless,  <span class="verse">11</span> for their Defender is strong.  He will plead their case against you.  <span class="verse">12</span> Apply your heart to instruction,  and your ears to the words of knowledge.  <span class="verse">13</span> Don’t withhold correction from a child.  If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.  <span class="verse">14</span> Punish him with the rod,  and save his soul from Sheol. <span class="verse">15</span> My son, if your heart is wise,  then my heart will be glad, even mine.  <span class="verse">16</span> Yes, my heart will rejoice  when your lips speak what is right.  <span class="verse">17</span> Don’t let your heart envy sinners,  but rather fear Yahweh all day long.  <span class="verse">18</span> Indeed surely there is a future hope,  and your hope will not be cut off.

His disciples also followed him.   <span class="verse">40</span> When he was at the place, he said to them,  “Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.” <span class="verse">41</span> He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,   <span class="verse">42</span> saying,  “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.” <span class="verse">43</span> An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.   <span class="verse">44</span> Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.  <span class="verse">45</span> When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,   <span class="verse">46</span> and said to them,  “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 6:13-20</span>  <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">13</span> For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself,   <span class="verse">14</span> saying, “Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.” <span class="verse">15</span> Thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.   <span class="verse">16</span> For men indeed swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.   <span class="verse">17</span> In this way God, being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath,   <span class="verse">18</span> that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.   <span class="verse">19</span> This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;   <span class="verse">20</span> where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
