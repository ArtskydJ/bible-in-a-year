		<span class="reference">Isaiah 29-30</span>  <span class="chapter">29</span><span class="verse">1</span> Woe to Ariel! Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come around;   <span class="verse">2</span> then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth. <span class="verse">3</span> I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you.   <span class="verse">4</span> You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.  <span class="verse">5</span> But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.   <span class="verse">6</span> She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire.   <span class="verse">7</span> The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.   <span class="verse">8</span> It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.  <span class="verse">9</span> Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.   <span class="verse">10</span> For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered your heads, the seers.   <span class="verse">11</span> All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t, for it is sealed;”   <span class="verse">12</span> and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t read.”  <span class="verse">13</span> The Lord said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and honors me with their lips, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught;   <span class="verse">14</span> therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh, and whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?”   <span class="verse">16</span> You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay; that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me;” or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding?”  <span class="verse">17</span> Isn’t it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?   <span class="verse">18</span> In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness.   <span class="verse">19</span> The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.   <span class="verse">20</span> For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off—   <span class="verse">21</span> who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for the arbiter in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.  <span class="verse">22</span> Therefore Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, says concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale.   <span class="verse">23</span> But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.   <span class="verse">24</span> They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will receive instruction.”   <span class="chapter">30</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Woe to the rebellious children”, says Yahweh, “who take counsel, but not from me; and who make an alliance, but not with my Spirit, that they may add sin to sin,   <span class="verse">2</span> who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked my advice, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!   <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.   <span class="verse">4</span> For their princes are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.   <span class="verse">5</span> They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can’t profit them, that are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.”  <span class="verse">6</span> The burden of the animals of the South.  Through the land of trouble and anguish, of the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to an unprofitable people.   <span class="verse">7</span> For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose; therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still.   <span class="verse">8</span> Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.   <span class="verse">9</span> For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear Yahweh’s law;   <span class="verse">10</span> who tell the seers, “Don’t see!” and the prophets, “Don’t prophesy to us right things. Tell us pleasant things. Prophesy deceits.   <span class="verse">11</span> Get out of the way. Turn away from the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.”   <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore the Holy One of Israel says, “Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it,   <span class="verse">13</span> therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.   <span class="verse">14</span> He will break it as a potter’s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there won’t be found among the broken pieces a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.”  <span class="verse">15</span> For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, “You will be saved in returning and rest. Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.” You refused,   <span class="verse">16</span> but you said, “No, for we will flee on horses;” therefore you will flee; and, “We will ride on the swift;” therefore those who pursue you will be swift.   <span class="verse">17</span> One thousand will flee at the threat of one. At the threat of five, you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain, and like a banner on a hill.  <span class="verse">18</span> Therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you, for Yahweh is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for him.   <span class="verse">19</span> For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. You will weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry. When he hears you, he will answer you.   <span class="verse">20</span> Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers won’t be hidden any more, but your eyes will see your teachers;   <span class="verse">21</span> and when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way. Walk in it.”   <span class="verse">22</span> You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold. You shall cast them away as an unclean thing. You shall tell it, “Go away!”  <span class="verse">23</span> He will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful. In that day, your livestock will feed in large pastures.   <span class="verse">24</span> The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory feed, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.   <span class="verse">25</span> There will be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.   <span class="verse">26</span> Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, in the day that Yahweh binds up the fracture of his people, and heals the wound they were struck with.  <span class="verse">27</span> Behold, Yahweh’s name comes from far away, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation. His tongue is as a devouring fire.   <span class="verse">28</span> His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. A bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples.   <span class="verse">29</span> You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh’s mountain, to Israel’s Rock.   <span class="verse">30</span> Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast, storm, and hailstones.   <span class="verse">31</span> For through Yahweh’s voice the Assyrian will be dismayed. He will strike him with his rod.   <span class="verse">32</span> Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps. He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.   <span class="verse">33</span> For his burning place has long been ready. Yes, for the king it is prepared. He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood. Yahweh’s breath, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.

Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him,  “Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.” <span class="verse">62</span> He went out, and wept bitterly.
