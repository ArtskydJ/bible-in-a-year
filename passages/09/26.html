		<span class="reference">Isaiah 57-58</span>  <span class="chapter">57</span><span class="verse">1</span> The righteous perish,  and no one lays it to heart.  Merciful men are taken away,  and no one considers that the righteous is taken away from the evil.  <span class="verse">2</span> He enters into peace.  They rest in their beds,  each one who walks in his uprightness.  <span class="verse">3</span> “But draw near here, you sons of a sorceress,  you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes.  <span class="verse">4</span> Whom do you mock?  Against whom do you make a wide mouth  and stick out your tongue?  Aren’t you children of disobedience  and offspring of falsehood,  <span class="verse">5</span> you who inflame yourselves among the oaks,  under every green tree;  who kill the children in the valleys,  under the clefts of the rocks?  <span class="verse">6</span> Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion.  They, they are your lot.  You have even poured a drink offering to them.  You have offered an offering.  Shall I be appeased for these things?  <span class="verse">7</span> On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed.  You also went up there to offer sacrifice.  <span class="verse">8</span> You have set up your memorial behind the doors and the posts,  for you have exposed yourself to someone besides me,  and have gone up.  You have enlarged your bed  and made you a covenant with them.  You loved what you saw on their bed.  <span class="verse">9</span> You went to the king with oil,  increased your perfumes,  sent your ambassadors far off,  and degraded yourself even to Sheol. <span class="verse">10</span> You were wearied with the length of your ways;  yet you didn’t say, ‘It is in vain.’  You found a reviving of your strength;  therefore you weren’t faint.  <span class="verse">11</span> “Whom have you dreaded and feared,  so that you lie,  and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart?  Haven’t I held my peace for a long time,  and you don’t fear me?  <span class="verse">12</span> I will declare your righteousness;  and as for your works, they will not benefit you.  <span class="verse">13</span> When you cry,  let those whom you have gathered deliver you;  but the wind will take them.  a breath will carry them all away:  but he who takes refuge in me will possess the land,  and will inherit my holy mountain.”  <span class="verse">14</span> He will say, “Build up, build up, prepare the way!  Remove the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.”  <span class="verse">15</span> For the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity,  whose name is Holy, says:  “I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit,  to revive the spirit of the humble,  and to revive the heart of the contrite.  <span class="verse">16</span> For I will not contend forever, neither will I always be angry;  for the spirit would faint before me,  and the souls whom I have made.  <span class="verse">17</span> I was angry because of the iniquity of his covetousness and struck him.  I hid myself and was angry;  and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.  <span class="verse">18</span> I have seen his ways, and will heal him.  I will lead him also,  and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.  <span class="verse">19</span> I create the fruit of the lips:  Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near,”  says Yahweh; “and I will heal them.”  <span class="verse">20</span> But the wicked are like the troubled sea;  for it can’t rest and its waters cast up mire and mud.  <span class="verse">21</span> “There is no peace”, says my God,  “for the wicked.”   <span class="chapter">58</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Cry aloud! Don’t spare!  Lift up your voice like a trumpet!  Declare to my people their disobedience,  and to the house of Jacob their sins.  <span class="verse">2</span> Yet they seek me daily,  and delight to know my ways.  As a nation that did righteousness,  and didn’t forsake the ordinance of their God,  they ask of me righteous judgments.  They delight to draw near to God.  <span class="verse">3</span> ‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and you don’t see?  Why have we afflicted our soul, and you don’t notice?’  “Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure,  and oppress all your laborers.  <span class="verse">4</span> Behold, you fast for strife and contention,  and to strike with the fist of wickedness.  You don’t fast today so as to make your voice to be heard on high.  <span class="verse">5</span> Is this the fast that I have chosen?  A day for a man to humble his soul?  Is it to bow down his head like a reed,  and to spread sackcloth and ashes under himself?  Will you call this a fast,  and an acceptable day to Yahweh?  <span class="verse">6</span> “Isn’t this the fast that I have chosen:  to release the bonds of wickedness,  to undo the straps of the yoke,  to let the oppressed go free,  and that you break every yoke?  <span class="verse">7</span> Isn’t it to distribute your bread to the hungry,  and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house?  When you see the naked,  that you cover him;  and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?  <span class="verse">8</span> Then your light will break out as the morning,  and your healing will appear quickly;  then your righteousness shall go before you,  and Yahweh’s glory will be your rear guard.  <span class="verse">9</span> Then you will call, and Yahweh will answer.  You will cry for help, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’  “If you take away from among you the yoke,  finger pointing,  and speaking wickedly;  <span class="verse">10</span> and if you pour out your soul to the hungry,  and satisfy the afflicted soul,  then your light will rise in darkness,  and your obscurity will be as the noonday;  <span class="verse">11</span> and Yahweh will guide you continually,  satisfy your soul in dry places,  and make your bones strong.  You will be like a watered garden,  and like a spring of water  whose waters don’t fail.  <span class="verse">12</span> Those who will be of you will build the old waste places.  You will raise up the foundations of many generations.  You will be called Repairer of the Breach,  Restorer of Paths with Dwellings.  <span class="verse">13</span> “If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath,  from doing your pleasure on my holy day;  and call the Sabbath a delight,  and the holy of Yahweh honorable;  and honor it,  not doing your own ways,  nor finding your own pleasure,  nor speaking your own words,  <span class="verse">14</span> then you will delight yourself in Yahweh,  and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth,  and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father;”  for Yahweh’s mouth has spoken it.

For the time would fail me if I told of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets,   <span class="verse">33</span> who through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, <span class="verse">34</span> quenched the power of fire,  escaped the edge of the sword,  from weakness were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign armies to flee.   <span class="verse">35</span> Women received their dead by resurrection.  Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.   <span class="verse">36</span> Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by bonds and imprisonment.   <span class="verse">37</span> They were stoned.  They were sawn apart. They were tempted. They were slain with the sword.  They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated—   <span class="verse">38</span> of whom the world was not worthy—wandering in deserts, mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.   <span class="verse">39</span> These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith, didn’t receive the promise,   <span class="verse">40</span> God having provided some better thing concerning us, so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
