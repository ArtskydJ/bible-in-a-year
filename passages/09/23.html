		<span class="reference">Isaiah 49-50</span>  <span class="chapter">49</span><span class="verse">1</span> Listen, islands, to me.  Listen, you peoples, from afar:  Yahweh has called me from the womb;  from the inside of my mother, he has mentioned my name.  <span class="verse">2</span> He has made my mouth like a sharp sword.  He has hidden me in the shadow of his hand.  He has made me a polished shaft.  He has kept me close in his quiver.  <span class="verse">3</span> He said to me, “You are my servant,  Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”  <span class="verse">4</span> But I said, “I have labored in vain.  I have spent my strength in vain for nothing;  yet surely the justice due to me is with Yahweh,  and my reward with my God.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Now Yahweh, he who formed me from the womb to be his servant,  says to bring Jacob again to him,  and to gather Israel to him,  for I am honorable in Yahweh’s eyes,  and my God has become my strength.  <span class="verse">6</span> Indeed, he says, “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,  and to restore the preserved of Israel.  I will also give you as a light to the nations,  that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.”  <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,  says to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers:  “Kings shall see and rise up,  princes, and they shall worship,  because of Yahweh who is faithful, even the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh says, “I have answered you in an acceptable time.  I have helped you in a day of salvation.  I will preserve you and give you for a covenant of the people,  to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritage,  <span class="verse">9</span> saying to those who are bound, ‘Come out!’;  to those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves!’  “They shall feed along the paths,  and their pasture shall be on all treeless heights.  <span class="verse">10</span> They shall not hunger nor thirst;  neither shall the heat nor sun strike them:  for he who has mercy on them will lead them.  He will guide them by springs of water.  <span class="verse">11</span> I will make all my mountains a road,  and my highways shall be exalted.  <span class="verse">12</span> Behold, these shall come from afar,  and behold, these from the north and from the west;  and these from the land of Sinim.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Sing, heavens, and be joyful, earth!  Break out into singing, mountains,  for Yahweh has comforted his people,  and will have compassion on his afflicted.  <span class="verse">14</span> But Zion said, “Yahweh has forsaken me,  and the Lord has forgotten me.”  <span class="verse">15</span> “Can a woman forget her nursing child,  that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?  Yes, these may forget,  yet I will not forget you!  <span class="verse">16</span> Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands.  Your walls are continually before me.  <span class="verse">17</span> Your children hurry.  Your destroyers and those who devastated you will leave you.  <span class="verse">18</span> Lift up your eyes all around, and see:  all these gather themselves together, and come to you.  As I live,” says Yahweh, “you shall surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament,  and dress yourself with them, like a bride.  <span class="verse">19</span> “For, as for your waste and your desolate places,  and your land that has been destroyed,  surely now that land will be too small for the inhabitants,  and those who swallowed you up will be far away.  <span class="verse">20</span> The children of your bereavement will say in your ears,  ‘This place is too small for me.  Give me a place to live in.’  <span class="verse">21</span> Then you will say in your heart, ‘Who has conceived these for me, since I have been bereaved of my children  and am alone, an exile, and wandering back and forth?  Who has brought these up?  Behold, I was left alone. Where were these?’ ”  <span class="verse">22</span> The Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations,  and lift up my banner to the peoples.  They shall bring your sons in their bosom,  and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.  <span class="verse">23</span> Kings shall be your foster fathers,  and their queens your nursing mothers.  They will bow down to you with their faces to the earth,  and lick the dust of your feet.  Then you will know that I am Yahweh;  and those who wait for me shall not be disappointed.”  <span class="verse">24</span> Shall the plunder be taken from the mighty,  or the lawful captives be delivered?  <span class="verse">25</span> But Yahweh says, “Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,  and the plunder retrieved from the fierce,  for I will contend with him who contends with you  and I will save your children.  <span class="verse">26</span> I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh;  and they will be drunk on their own blood, as with sweet wine.  Then all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior  and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”   <span class="chapter">50</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh says, “Where is the bill of your mother’s divorce, with which I have put her away?  Or to which of my creditors have I sold you?  Behold, you were sold for your iniquities,  and your mother was put away for your transgressions.  <span class="verse">2</span> Why, when I came, was there no one?  When I called, why was there no one to answer?  Is my hand shortened at all, that it can’t redeem?  Or have I no power to deliver?  Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea.  I make the rivers a wilderness.  Their fish stink because there is no water, and die of thirst.  <span class="verse">3</span> I clothe the heavens with blackness.  I make sackcloth their covering.”  <span class="verse">4</span> The Lord Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught,  that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary.  He awakens morning by morning,  he awakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.  <span class="verse">5</span> The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear.  I was not rebellious.  I have not turned back.  <span class="verse">6</span> I gave my back to those who beat me,  and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair.  I didn’t hide my face from shame and spitting.  <span class="verse">7</span> For the Lord Yahweh will help me.  Therefore I have not been confounded.  Therefore I have set my face like a flint,  and I know that I won’t be disappointed.  <span class="verse">8</span> He who justifies me is near.  Who will bring charges against me?  Let us stand up together.  Who is my adversary?  Let him come near to me.  <span class="verse">9</span> Behold, the Lord Yahweh will help me!  Who is he who will condemn me?  Behold, they will all grow old like a garment.  The moths will eat them up.  <span class="verse">10</span> Who among you fears Yahweh  and obeys the voice of his servant?  He who walks in darkness  and has no light,  let him trust in Yahweh’s name,  and rely on his God.  <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, all you who kindle a fire,  who adorn yourselves with torches around yourselves,  walk in the flame of your fire,  and among the torches that you have kindled.  You will have this from my hand:  you will lie down in sorrow.

One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.  <span class="verse">17</span> A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death;  no one will support him.  <span class="verse">18</span> Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe;  but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.  <span class="verse">19</span> One who works his land will have an abundance of food;  but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.  <span class="verse">20</span> A faithful man is rich with blessings;  but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.  <span class="verse">21</span> To show partiality is not good;  yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.  <span class="verse">22</span> A stingy man hurries after riches,  and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.  <span class="verse">23</span> One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor  than one who flatters with the tongue.  <span class="verse">24</span> Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, “It’s not wrong,”  is a partner with a destroyer.  <span class="verse">25</span> One who is greedy stirs up strife;  but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper.  <span class="verse">26</span> One who trusts in himself is a fool;  but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.  <span class="verse">27</span> One who gives to the poor has no lack;  but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.  <span class="verse">28</span> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;  but when they perish, the righteous thrive.

On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.

For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God.   <span class="verse">6</span> Without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him.   <span class="verse">7</span> By faith, Noah, being warned about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear,  prepared a ship for the saving of his house, through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.
