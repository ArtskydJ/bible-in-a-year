		<span class="reference">Isaiah 66</span>  <span class="chapter">66</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh says,  “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.  What kind of house will you build to me?  Where will I rest?  <span class="verse">2</span> For my hand has made all these things,  and so all these things came to be,” says Yahweh:  “but I will look to this man,  even to he who is poor and of a contrite spirit,  and who trembles at my word.  <span class="verse">3</span> He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man;  he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog’s neck;  he who offers an offering, as he who offers pig’s blood;  he who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol.  Yes, they have chosen their own ways,  and their soul delights in their abominations:  <span class="verse">4</span> I also will choose their delusions,  and will bring their fears on them;  because when I called, no one answered;  when I spoke, they didn’t listen;  but they did that which was evil in my eyes,  and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Hear Yahweh’s word,  you who tremble at his word:  “Your brothers who hate you,  who cast you out for my name’s sake, have said,  ‘Let Yahweh be glorified,  that we may see your joy;’  but it is those who shall be disappointed.  <span class="verse">6</span> A voice of tumult from the city,  a voice from the temple,  a voice of Yahweh that repays his enemies what they deserve.  <span class="verse">7</span> “Before she travailed, she gave birth.  Before her pain came, she delivered a son.  <span class="verse">8</span> Who has heard of such a thing?  Who has seen such things?  Shall a land be born in one day?  Shall a nation be born at once?  For as soon as Zion travailed,  she gave birth to her children.  <span class="verse">9</span> Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to be delivered?” says Yahweh.  “Shall I who cause to give birth shut the womb?” says your God.  <span class="verse">10</span> “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her.  Rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;  <span class="verse">11</span> that you may nurse and be satisfied at the comforting breasts;  that you may drink deeply,  and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.”  <span class="verse">12</span> For Yahweh says, “Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,  and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;  and you will nurse.  You will be carried on her side,  and will be dandled on her knees.  <span class="verse">13</span> As one whom his mother comforts,  so I will comfort you.  You will be comforted in Jerusalem.”  <span class="verse">14</span> You will see it, and your heart shall rejoice,  and your bones will flourish like the tender grass.  Yahweh’s hand will be known among his servants;  and he will have indignation against his enemies.  <span class="verse">15</span> For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire,  and his chariots will be like the whirlwind;  to render his anger with fierceness,  and his rebuke with flames of fire.  <span class="verse">16</span> For Yahweh will execute judgment by fire and by his sword on all flesh;  and those slain by Yahweh will be many.  <span class="verse">17</span> “Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to go to the gardens, behind one in the middle, eating pig’s meat, abominable things, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">18</span> “For I know their works and their thoughts. The time comes that I will gather all nations and languages, and they will come, and will see my glory.  <span class="verse">19</span> “I will set a sign among them, and I will send those who escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to far-away islands, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.   <span class="verse">20</span> They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an offering to Yahweh, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their offering in a clean vessel into Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">21</span> Of them I will also select priests and Levites,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">22</span> “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me,” says Yahweh, “so your offspring and your name shall remain.   <span class="verse">23</span> It shall happen that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh will come to worship before me,” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">24</span> “They will go out, and look at the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me; for their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”

		<span class="reference">Proverbs 31:10-31</span>  <span class="chapter">31</span><span class="verse">10</span> Who can find a worthy woman?  For her price is far above rubies.  <span class="verse">11</span> The heart of her husband trusts in her.  He shall have no lack of gain.  <span class="verse">12</span> She does him good, and not harm,  all the days of her life.  <span class="verse">13</span> She seeks wool and flax,  and works eagerly with her hands.  <span class="verse">14</span> She is like the merchant ships.  She brings her bread from afar.  <span class="verse">15</span> She rises also while it is yet night,  gives food to her household,  and portions for her servant girls.  <span class="verse">16</span> She considers a field, and buys it.  With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.  <span class="verse">17</span> She arms her waist with strength,  and makes her arms strong.  <span class="verse">18</span> She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.  Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.  <span class="verse">19</span> She lays her hands to the distaff,  and her hands hold the spindle.  <span class="verse">20</span> She opens her arms to the poor;  yes, she extends her hands to the needy.  <span class="verse">21</span> She is not afraid of the snow for her household;  for all her household are clothed with scarlet.  <span class="verse">22</span> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.  Her clothing is fine linen and purple.  <span class="verse">23</span> Her husband is respected in the gates,  when he sits among the elders of the land.  <span class="verse">24</span> She makes linen garments and sells them,  and delivers sashes to the merchant.  <span class="verse">25</span> Strength and dignity are her clothing.  She laughs at the time to come.  <span class="verse">26</span> She opens her mouth with wisdom.  Kind instruction is on her tongue.  <span class="verse">27</span> She looks well to the ways of her household,  and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.  <span class="verse">28</span> Her children rise up and call her blessed.  Her husband also praises her:  <span class="verse">29</span> “Many women do noble things,  but you excel them all.”  <span class="verse">30</span> Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;  but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.  <span class="verse">31</span> Give her of the fruit of her hands!  Let her works praise her in the gates!

But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.”  <span class="verse">50</span> He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.   <span class="verse">51</span> While he blessed them, he withdrew from them, and was carried up into heaven.   <span class="verse">52</span> They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,   <span class="verse">53</span> and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

		<span class="reference">Hebrews 13:9-25</span>  <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">9</span> Don’t be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by food, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.  <span class="verse">10</span> We have an altar from which those who serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat.   <span class="verse">11</span> For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside of the camp. <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.   <span class="verse">13</span> Let’s therefore go out to him outside of the camp, bearing his reproach.   <span class="verse">14</span> For we don’t have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to come.   <span class="verse">15</span> Through him, then, let’s offer up a sacrifice of praise to God   continually, that is, the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name.   <span class="verse">16</span> But don’t forget to be doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.  <span class="verse">17</span> Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy, and not with groaning, for that would be unprofitable for you.  <span class="verse">18</span> Pray for us, for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.   <span class="verse">19</span> I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner.  <span class="verse">20</span> Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus,   <span class="verse">21</span> make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.  <span class="verse">22</span> But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation; for I have written to you in few words.   <span class="verse">23</span> Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.  <span class="verse">24</span> Greet all of your leaders and all the saints. The Italians greet you.  <span class="verse">25</span> Grace be with you all. Amen.
