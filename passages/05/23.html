		<span class="reference">2 Samuel 13</span>  <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> After this, Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.   <span class="verse">2</span> Amnon was so troubled that he became sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.   <span class="verse">3</span> But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.   <span class="verse">4</span> He said to him, “Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won’t you tell me?”  Amnon said to him, “I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Jonadab said to him, “Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.’ ”  <span class="verse">6</span> So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.”  <span class="verse">7</span> Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”   <span class="verse">8</span> So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was lying down. She took dough, and kneaded it, made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.   <span class="verse">9</span> She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, “Have all men leave me.” Then every man went out from him.   <span class="verse">10</span> Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.   <span class="verse">11</span> When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister!”  <span class="verse">12</span> She answered him, “No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don’t you do this folly.   <span class="verse">13</span> As for me, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”  <span class="verse">14</span> However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.   <span class="verse">15</span> Then Amnon hated her with exceedingly great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, “Arise, be gone!”  <span class="verse">16</span> She said to him, “Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!”  But he would not listen to her.   <span class="verse">17</span> Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, “Now put this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.”  <span class="verse">18</span> She had a garment of various colors on her; for the king’s daughters who were virgins dressed in such robes. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.   <span class="verse">19</span> Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.   <span class="verse">20</span> Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.”  So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.   <span class="verse">21</span> But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.   <span class="verse">22</span> Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.   <span class="verse">23</span> After two full years, Absalom had sheep shearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.   <span class="verse">24</span> Absalom came to the king, and said, “See now, your servant has sheep shearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”  <span class="verse">25</span> The king said to Absalom, “No, my son, let’s not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.” He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.  <span class="verse">26</span> Then Absalom said, “If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.”  The king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”  <span class="verse">27</span> But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.   <span class="verse">28</span> Absalom commanded his servants, saying, “Mark now, when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Haven’t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!”  <span class="verse">29</span> The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled.   <span class="verse">30</span> While they were on the way, the news came to David, saying, “Absalom has slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left!”  <span class="verse">31</span> Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.   <span class="verse">32</span> Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered, “Don’t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.   <span class="verse">33</span> Now therefore don’t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead; for only Amnon is dead.”   <span class="verse">34</span> But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.   <span class="verse">35</span> Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the king’s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.”   <span class="verse">36</span> As soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.   <span class="verse">37</span> But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.   <span class="verse">38</span> So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.   <span class="verse">39</span> King David longed to go out to Absalom; for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.

He didn’t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.  <span class="verse">18</span> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.  It came into his inward parts like water,  like oil into his bones.  <span class="verse">19</span> Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,  for the belt that is always around him.  <span class="verse">20</span> This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh,  of those who speak evil against my soul.  <span class="verse">21</span> But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord,  for your name’s sake,  because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;  <span class="verse">22</span> for I am poor and needy.  My heart is wounded within me.  <span class="verse">23</span> I fade away like an evening shadow.  I am shaken off like a locust.  <span class="verse">24</span> My knees are weak through fasting.  My body is thin and lacks fat.  <span class="verse">25</span> I have also become a reproach to them.  When they see me, they shake their head.  <span class="verse">26</span> Help me, Yahweh, my God.  Save me according to your loving kindness;  <span class="verse">27</span> that they may know that this is your hand;  that you, Yahweh, have done it.  <span class="verse">28</span> They may curse, but you bless.  When they arise, they will be shamed,  but your servant shall rejoice.  <span class="verse">29</span> Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.  Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.  <span class="verse">30</span> I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth.  Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.  <span class="verse">31</span> For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,  to save him from those who judge his soul.

Seize him, and lead him away safely.”   <span class="verse">45</span> When he had come, immediately he came to him, and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed him.   <span class="verse">46</span> They laid their hands on him, and seized him.   <span class="verse">47</span> But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  <span class="verse">48</span> Jesus answered them,  “Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?  <span class="verse">49</span> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.” <span class="verse">50</span> They all left him, and fled.   <span class="verse">51</span> A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men grabbed him,   <span class="verse">52</span> but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

		<span class="reference">Galatians 2:1-10</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.   <span class="verse">2</span> I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain.   <span class="verse">3</span> But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.   <span class="verse">4</span> This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage,   <span class="verse">5</span> to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you.   <span class="verse">6</span> But from those who were reputed to be important—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn’t show partiality to man—they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me,   <span class="verse">7</span> but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcised—   <span class="verse">8</span> for he who worked through Peter in the apostleship with the circumcised also worked through me with the Gentiles—   <span class="verse">9</span> and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, those who were reputed to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision.   <span class="verse">10</span> They only asked us to remember the poor—which very thing I was also zealous to do.
