		<span class="reference">1 Samuel 7-8</span>  <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> The men of Kiriath Jearim came and took Yahweh’s ark, and brought it into Abinadab’s house on the hill, and consecrated Eleazar his son to keep Yahweh’s ark.   <span class="verse">2</span> From the day that the ark stayed in Kiriath Jearim, the time was long; for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.   <span class="verse">3</span> Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you are returning to Yahweh with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only; and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.”   <span class="verse">4</span> Then the children of Israel removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth, and served Yahweh only.   <span class="verse">5</span> Samuel said, “Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to Yahweh for you.”   <span class="verse">6</span> They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh.” Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.   <span class="verse">7</span> When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.   <span class="verse">8</span> The children of Israel said to Samuel, “Don’t stop crying to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.”   <span class="verse">9</span> Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel; and Yahweh answered him.   <span class="verse">10</span> As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines came near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.   <span class="verse">11</span> The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.  <span class="verse">12</span> Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer,  saying, “Yahweh helped us until now.”   <span class="verse">13</span> So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped coming within the border of Israel. Yahweh’s hand was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.  <span class="verse">14</span> The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel recovered its border out of the hand of the Philistines. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.  <span class="verse">15</span> Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.   <span class="verse">16</span> He went from year to year in a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.   <span class="verse">17</span> His return was to Ramah, for his house was there; and he judged Israel there; and he built an altar to Yahweh there.   <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel.   <span class="verse">2</span> Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba.   <span class="verse">3</span> His sons didn’t walk in his ways, but turned away after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.   <span class="verse">4</span> Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel to Ramah.   <span class="verse">5</span> They said to him, “Behold, you are old, and your sons don’t walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”   <span class="verse">6</span> But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.”  Samuel prayed to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me as the king over them.   <span class="verse">8</span> According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so they also do to you.   <span class="verse">9</span> Now therefore listen to their voice. However you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who will reign over them.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Samuel told all Yahweh’s words to the people who asked him for a king.   <span class="verse">11</span> He said, “This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them as his servants, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they will run before his chariots.   <span class="verse">12</span> He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.   <span class="verse">13</span> He will take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks, and to be bakers.   <span class="verse">14</span> He will take your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, even their best, and give them to his servants.   <span class="verse">15</span> He will take one tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give it to his officers, and to his servants.   <span class="verse">16</span> He will take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys, and assign them to his own work.   <span class="verse">17</span> He will take one tenth of your flocks; and you will be his servants.   <span class="verse">18</span> You will cry out in that day because of your king whom you will have chosen for yourselves; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.”  <span class="verse">19</span> But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, “No; but we will have a king over us,   <span class="verse">20</span> that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.”  <span class="verse">21</span> Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of Yahweh.   <span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to their voice, and make them a king.”  Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Everyone go to your own city.”

		<span class="reference">Mark 10:17-31</span>  <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">17</span> As he was going out into the way, one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”  <span class="verse">18</span> Jesus said to him,  “Why do you call me good? No one is good except one—God.  <span class="verse">19</span> You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder,’ ‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’ ‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’ ” <span class="verse">20</span> He said to him, “Teacher, I have observed all these things from my youth.”  <span class="verse">21</span> Jesus looking at him loved him, and said to him,  “One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, taking up the cross.” <span class="verse">22</span> But his face fell at that saying, and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great possessions.   <span class="verse">23</span> Jesus looked around, and said to his disciples,  “How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!” <span class="verse">24</span> The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answered again,  “Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!  <span class="verse">25</span> It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.” <span class="verse">26</span> They were exceedingly astonished, saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”  <span class="verse">27</span> Jesus, looking at them, said,  “With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.” <span class="verse">28</span> Peter began to tell him, “Behold, we have left all, and have followed you.”  <span class="verse">29</span> Jesus said,  “Most certainly I tell you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for the sake of the Good News,  <span class="verse">30</span> but he will receive one hundred times more now in this time: houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.  <span class="verse">31</span> But many who are first will be last; and the last first.”

		<span class="reference">2 Corinthians 3</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as do some, letters of commendation to you or from you?   <span class="verse">2</span> You are our letter, written in our hearts, known and read by all men,   <span class="verse">3</span> being revealed that you are a letter of Christ, served by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in tablets that are hearts of flesh.   <span class="verse">4</span> Such confidence we have through Christ toward God,   <span class="verse">5</span> not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God,   <span class="verse">6</span> who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.   <span class="verse">7</span> But if the service of death, written engraved on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look steadfastly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face, which was passing away,   <span class="verse">8</span> won’t service of the Spirit be with much more glory?   <span class="verse">9</span> For if the service of condemnation has glory, the service of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.   <span class="verse">10</span> For most certainly that which has been made glorious has not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasses.   <span class="verse">11</span> For if that which passes away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.  <span class="verse">12</span> Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech,   <span class="verse">13</span> and not as Moses, who put a veil on his face, that the children of Israel wouldn’t look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away.   <span class="verse">14</span> But their minds were hardened, for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains, because in Christ it passes away.   <span class="verse">15</span> But to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.   <span class="verse">16</span> But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.   <span class="verse">17</span> Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.   <span class="verse">18</span> But we all, with unveiled face seeing the glory of the Lord as in a mirror, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord, the Spirit.
