		<span class="reference">2 Samuel 11-12</span>  <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> At the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">2</span> At evening, David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the king’s house. From the roof, he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to look at.   <span class="verse">3</span> David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, Uriah the Hittite’s wife?”  <span class="verse">4</span> David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.   <span class="verse">5</span> The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, “I am with child.”  <span class="verse">6</span> David sent to Joab, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” Joab sent Uriah to David.   <span class="verse">7</span> When Uriah had come to him, David asked him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.   <span class="verse">8</span> David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.   <span class="verse">9</span> But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn’t go down to his house.   <span class="verse">10</span> When they had told David, saying, “Uriah didn’t go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Haven’t you come from a journey? Why didn’t you go down to your house?”  <span class="verse">11</span> Uriah said to David, “The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!”  <span class="verse">12</span> David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.   <span class="verse">13</span> When David had called him, he ate and drank before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn’t go down to his house.   <span class="verse">14</span> In the morning, David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.   <span class="verse">15</span> He wrote in the letter, saying, “Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.”  <span class="verse">16</span> When Joab kept watch on the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.   <span class="verse">17</span> The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of David’s servants; and Uriah the Hittite died also.   <span class="verse">18</span> Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;   <span class="verse">19</span> and he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,   <span class="verse">20</span> it shall be that, if the king’s wrath arise, and he asks you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they would shoot from the wall?   <span class="verse">21</span> Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn’t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’ ”  <span class="verse">22</span> So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.   <span class="verse">23</span> The messenger said to David, “The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.   <span class="verse">24</span> The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.”  <span class="verse">25</span> Then David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab, ‘Don’t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.’ Encourage him.”  <span class="verse">26</span> When Uriah’s wife heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.   <span class="verse">27</span> When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.   <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, “There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.   <span class="verse">2</span> The rich man had very many flocks and herds,   <span class="verse">3</span> but the poor man had nothing, except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and raised. It grew up together with him, and with his children. It ate of his own food, drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was like a daughter to him.   <span class="verse">4</span> A traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to prepare for the wayfaring man who had come to him, but took the poor man’s lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him.”  <span class="verse">5</span> David’s anger burned hot against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As Yahweh lives, the man who has done this deserves to die!   <span class="verse">6</span> He must restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity!”  <span class="verse">7</span> Nathan said to David, “You are the man. This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul.   <span class="verse">8</span> I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that would have been too little, I would have added to you many more such things.   <span class="verse">9</span> Why have you despised Yahweh’s word, to do that which is evil in his sight? You have struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.   <span class="verse">10</span> Now therefore the sword will never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken Uriah the Hittite’s wife to be your wife.’  <span class="verse">11</span> “This is what Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.   <span class="verse">12</span> For you did this secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.’ ”  <span class="verse">13</span> David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.”  Nathan said to David, “Yahweh also has put away your sin. You will not die.   <span class="verse">14</span> However, because by this deed you have given great occasion to Yahweh’s enemies to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you will surely die.”   <span class="verse">15</span> Nathan departed to his house.  Yahweh struck the child that Uriah’s wife bore to David, and it was very sick.   <span class="verse">16</span> David therefore begged God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the ground.   <span class="verse">17</span> The elders of his house arose beside him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, and he didn’t eat bread with them.   <span class="verse">18</span> On the seventh day, the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he didn’t listen to our voice. How will he then harm himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?”  <span class="verse">19</span> But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?”  They said, “He is dead.”  <span class="verse">20</span> Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothing; and he came into Yahweh’s house, and worshiped. Then he came to his own house; and when he requested, they set bread before him, and he ate.   <span class="verse">21</span> Then his servants said to him, “What is this that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive, but when the child was dead, you rose up and ate bread.”  <span class="verse">22</span> He said, “While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, ‘Who knows whether Yahweh will not be gracious to me, that the child may live?’   <span class="verse">23</span> But now he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me.”  <span class="verse">24</span> David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her. She bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. Yahweh loved him;   <span class="verse">25</span> and he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah,  for Yahweh’s sake.  <span class="verse">26</span> Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.   <span class="verse">27</span> Joab sent messengers to David, and said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Yes, I have taken the city of waters.   <span class="verse">28</span> Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name.”  <span class="verse">29</span> David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.   <span class="verse">30</span> He took the crown of their king from off his head; and its weight was a talent  of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was set on David’s head. He brought a great quantity of plunder out of the city.   <span class="verse">31</span> He brought out the people who were in it, and put them under saws, under iron picks, under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brick kiln; and he did so to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.  <span class="verse">3</span> They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,  and fought against me without a cause.  <span class="verse">4</span> In return for my love, they are my adversaries;  but I am in prayer.  <span class="verse">5</span> They have rewarded me evil for good,  and hatred for my love.  <span class="verse">6</span> Set a wicked man over him.  Let an adversary stand at his right hand.  <span class="verse">7</span> When he is judged, let him come out guilty.  Let his prayer be turned into sin.  <span class="verse">8</span> Let his days be few.  Let another take his office.  <span class="verse">9</span> Let his children be fatherless,  and his wife a widow.  <span class="verse">10</span> Let his children be wandering beggars.  Let them be sought from their ruins.  <span class="verse">11</span> Let the creditor seize all that he has.

In the generation following let their name be blotted out.  <span class="verse">14</span> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.  Don’t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.  <span class="verse">15</span> Let them be before Yahweh continually,  that he may cut off their memory from the earth;  <span class="verse">16</span> because he didn’t remember to show kindness,  but persecuted the poor and needy man,  the broken in heart, to kill them.

He said to his disciples,  “Sit here, while I pray.” <span class="verse">33</span> He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed.   <span class="verse">34</span> He said to them,  “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here, and watch.” <span class="verse">35</span> He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.   <span class="verse">36</span> He said,  “Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but what you desire.”  <span class="verse">37</span> He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter,  “Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one hour?  <span class="verse">38</span> Watch and pray, that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” <span class="verse">39</span> Again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.   <span class="verse">40</span> Again he returned, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they didn’t know what to answer him.   <span class="verse">41</span> He came the third time, and said to them,  “Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  <span class="verse">42</span> Arise! Let’s get going. Behold: he who betrays me is at hand.”

Then I returned to Damascus.  <span class="verse">18</span> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.   <span class="verse">19</span> But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother.   <span class="verse">20</span> Now about the things which I write to you, behold,  before God, I’m not lying.   <span class="verse">21</span> Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.   <span class="verse">22</span> I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,   <span class="verse">23</span> but they only heard: “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”   <span class="verse">24</span> So they glorified God in me.
