		<span class="reference">1 Samuel 3-4</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli. Yahweh’s word was rare in those days. There were not many visions, then.   <span class="verse">2</span> At that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),   <span class="verse">3</span> and God’s lamp hadn’t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down in Yahweh’s temple where God’s ark was,   <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh called Samuel. He said, “Here I am.”  <span class="verse">5</span> He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”  He said, “I didn’t call. Lie down again.”  He went and lay down.   <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh called yet again, “Samuel!”  Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”  He answered, “I didn’t call, my son. Lie down again.”   <span class="verse">7</span> Now Samuel didn’t yet know Yahweh, neither was Yahweh’s word yet revealed to him.   <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; for you called me.”  Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.   <span class="verse">9</span> Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down. It shall be, if he calls you, that you shall say, ‘Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.   <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”  Then Samuel said, “Speak; for your servant hears.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said to Samuel, “Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.   <span class="verse">12</span> In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.   <span class="verse">13</span> For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse on themselves, and he didn’t restrain them.   <span class="verse">14</span> Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be removed with sacrifice or offering forever.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of Yahweh’s house. Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision.   <span class="verse">16</span> Then Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son!”  He said, “Here I am.”  <span class="verse">17</span> He said, “What is the thing that he has spoken to you? Please don’t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.”  <span class="verse">18</span> Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him.  He said, “It is Yahweh. Let him do what seems good to him.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.   <span class="verse">20</span> All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.   <span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by Yahweh’s word.   <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word of Samuel came to all Israel.  Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.   <span class="verse">2</span> The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. When they joined battle, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men of the army in the field.   <span class="verse">3</span> When the people had come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let’s get the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of Shiloh and bring it to us, that it may come among us and save us out of the hand of our enemies.”  <span class="verse">4</span> So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.   <span class="verse">5</span> When the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth resounded.   <span class="verse">6</span> When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” They understood that Yahweh’s ark had come into the camp.   <span class="verse">7</span> The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” They said, “Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing before.   <span class="verse">8</span> Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.   <span class="verse">9</span> Be strong and behave like men, O you Philistines, that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Strengthen yourselves like men, and fight!”   <span class="verse">10</span> The Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and each man fled to his tent. There was a very great slaughter; for thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell.   <span class="verse">11</span> God’s ark was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.  <span class="verse">12</span> A man of Benjamin ran out of the army and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head.   <span class="verse">13</span> When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for God’s ark. When the man came into the city and told about it, all the city cried out.   <span class="verse">14</span> When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, “What does the noise of this tumult mean?”  The man hurried, and came and told Eli.   <span class="verse">15</span> Now Eli was ninety-eight years old. His eyes were set, so that he could not see.   <span class="verse">16</span> The man said to Eli, “I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army.”  He said, “How did the matter go, my son?”  <span class="verse">17</span> He who brought the news answered, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and God’s ark has been captured.”  <span class="verse">18</span> When he made mention of God’s ark, Eli fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate; and his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.  <span class="verse">19</span> His daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to giving birth. When she heard the news that God’s ark was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and gave birth; for her pains came on her.   <span class="verse">20</span> About the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she didn’t answer, neither did she regard it.   <span class="verse">21</span> She named the child Ichabod,  saying, “The glory has departed from Israel!” because God’s ark was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.   <span class="verse">22</span> She said, “The glory has departed from Israel; for God’s ark has been taken.”

Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.  <span class="verse">2</span> Sing to Yahweh!  Bless his name!  Proclaim his salvation from day to day!  <span class="verse">3</span> Declare his glory among the nations,  his marvelous works among all the peoples.  <span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh is great, and greatly to be praised!  He is to be feared above all gods.  <span class="verse">5</span> For all the gods of the peoples are idols,  but Yahweh made the heavens.  <span class="verse">6</span> Honor and majesty are before him.  Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.  <span class="verse">7</span> Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations,  ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength.  <span class="verse">8</span> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Bring an offering, and come into his courts.  <span class="verse">9</span> Worship Yahweh in holy array.

It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into Gehenna,  into the unquenchable fire,  <span class="verse">44</span> ‘where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire is not quenched.’  <span class="verse">45</span> If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into Gehenna,  into the fire that will never be quenched— <span class="verse">46</span> ‘where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire is not quenched.’  <span class="verse">47</span> If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is better for you to enter into God’s Kingdom with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire,  <span class="verse">48</span> ‘where their worm doesn’t die, and the fire is not quenched.’  <span class="verse">49</span> For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be seasoned with salt.  <span class="verse">50</span> Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”

		<span class="reference">2 Corinthians 1:12-24</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">12</span> For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.   <span class="verse">13</span> For we write no other things to you than what you read or even acknowledge, and I hope you will acknowledge to the end,   <span class="verse">14</span> as also you acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.  <span class="verse">15</span> In this confidence, I was determined to come first to you, that you might have a second benefit,   <span class="verse">16</span> and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Judea.   <span class="verse">17</span> When I therefore was thus determined, did I show fickleness? Or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the “Yes, yes” and the “No, no?”   <span class="verse">18</span> But as God is faithful, our word toward you was not “Yes and no.”   <span class="verse">19</span> For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, by me, Silvanus, and Timothy, was not “Yes and no,” but in him is “Yes.”   <span class="verse">20</span> For however many are the promises of God, in him is the “Yes.” Therefore also through him is the “Amen”, to the glory of God through us.  <span class="verse">21</span> Now he who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,   <span class="verse">22</span> who also sealed us, and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.  <span class="verse">23</span> But I call God for a witness to my soul, that I didn’t come to Corinth to spare you.   <span class="verse">24</span> We don’t control your faith, but are fellow workers with you for your joy. For you stand firm in faith.
