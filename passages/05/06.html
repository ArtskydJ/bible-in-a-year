		<span class="reference">1 Samuel 11-13</span>  <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.”   <span class="verse">2</span> Nahash the Ammonite said to them, “On this condition I will make it with you, that all your right eyes be gouged out. I will make this dishonor all Israel.”  <span class="verse">3</span> The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days, that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to you.”   <span class="verse">4</span> Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these words in the ears of the people, then all the people lifted up their voice, and wept.  <span class="verse">5</span> Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field; and Saul said, “What ails the people that they weep?” They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.   <span class="verse">6</span> God’s Spirit came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger burned hot.   <span class="verse">7</span> He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever doesn’t come out after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.” The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.   <span class="verse">8</span> He counted them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.   <span class="verse">9</span> They said to the messengers who came, “Tell the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will be rescued.’ ” The messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.   <span class="verse">10</span> Therefore the men of Jabesh said, “Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.”   <span class="verse">11</span> On the next day, Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the middle of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who remained were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.   <span class="verse">12</span> The people said to Samuel, “Who is he who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring those men, that we may put them to death!”  <span class="verse">13</span> Saul said, “No man shall be put to death today; for today Yahweh has rescued Israel.”   <span class="verse">14</span> Then Samuel said to the people, “Come! Let’s go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.”   <span class="verse">15</span> All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal. There they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.   <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.   <span class="verse">2</span> Now, behold, the king walks before you. I am old and gray-headed. Behold, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth to this day.   <span class="verse">3</span> Here I am. Witness against me before Yahweh, and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Of whose hand have I taken a bribe to make me blind my eyes? I will restore it to you.”  <span class="verse">4</span> They said, “You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken anything from anyone’s hand.”  <span class="verse">5</span> He said to them, “Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed is witness today, that you have not found anything in my hand.”  They said, “He is witness.”   <span class="verse">6</span> Samuel said to the people, “It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse">7</span> Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which he did to you and to your fathers.  <span class="verse">8</span> “When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.  <span class="verse">9</span> “But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.   <span class="verse">10</span> They cried to Yahweh, and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.’   <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.  <span class="verse">12</span> “When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us;’ when Yahweh your God was your king.   <span class="verse">13</span> Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for. Behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.   <span class="verse">14</span> If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then both you and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh your God.   <span class="verse">15</span> But if you will not listen to Yahweh’s voice, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then Yahweh’s hand will be against you, as it was against your fathers.  <span class="verse">16</span> “Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.   <span class="verse">17</span> Isn’t it wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain; and you will know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in Yahweh’s sight, in asking for a king.”  <span class="verse">18</span> So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain that day. Then all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.  <span class="verse">19</span> All the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for a king.”  <span class="verse">20</span> Samuel said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. You have indeed done all this evil; yet don’t turn away from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart.   <span class="verse">21</span> Don’t turn away to go after vain things which can’t profit or deliver, for they are vain.   <span class="verse">22</span> For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people for himself.   <span class="verse">23</span> Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.   <span class="verse">24</span> Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things he has done for you.   <span class="verse">25</span> But if you keep doing evil, you will be consumed, both you and your king.”   <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years. <span class="verse">2</span> Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel, and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He sent the rest of the people to their own tents.   <span class="verse">3</span> Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”   <span class="verse">4</span> All Israel heard that Saul had struck the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was considered an abomination to the Philistines. The people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.   <span class="verse">5</span> The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude. They came up and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.   <span class="verse">6</span> When the men of Israel saw that they were in trouble (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in rocks, in tombs, and in pits.   <span class="verse">7</span> Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.   <span class="verse">8</span> He stayed seven days, according to the time set by Samuel; but Samuel didn’t come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.   <span class="verse">9</span> Saul said, “Bring the burnt offering to me here, and the peace offerings.” He offered the burnt offering.  <span class="verse">10</span> It came to pass that as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might greet him.   <span class="verse">11</span> Samuel said, “What have you done?”  Saul said, “Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn’t come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines assembled themselves together at Michmash;   <span class="verse">12</span> therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down on me to Gilgal, and I haven’t entreated the favor of Yahweh.’ I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Samuel said to Saul, “You have done foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you; for now Yahweh would have established your kingdom on Israel forever.   <span class="verse">14</span> But now your kingdom will not continue. Yahweh has sought for himself a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept that which Yahweh commanded you.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Samuel arose, and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.   <span class="verse">16</span> Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.   <span class="verse">17</span> The raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned to the way that leads to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;   <span class="verse">18</span> another company turned the way to Beth Horon; and another company turned the way of the border that looks down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.   <span class="verse">19</span> Now there was no blacksmith found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, “Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears”;   <span class="verse">20</span> but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, each man to sharpen his own plowshare, mattock, ax, and sickle.   <span class="verse">21</span> The price was one payim  each to sharpen mattocks, plowshares, pitchforks, axes, and goads.   <span class="verse">22</span> So it came to pass in the day of battle, that neither sword nor spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.   <span class="verse">23</span> The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.

As he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road.   <span class="verse">47</span> When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, “Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me!”   <span class="verse">48</span> Many rebuked him, that he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have mercy on me!”  <span class="verse">49</span> Jesus stood still, and said,  “Call him.” They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is calling you!”  <span class="verse">50</span> He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.  <span class="verse">51</span> Jesus asked him,  “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “Rabboni,  that I may see again.”  <span class="verse">52</span> Jesus said to him,  “Go your way. Your faith has made you well.”   Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus on the way.
