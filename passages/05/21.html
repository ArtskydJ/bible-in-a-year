		<span class="reference">2 Samuel 8-10</span>  <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> After this, David struck the Philistines and subdued them; and David took the bridle of the mother city out of the hand of the Philistines.   <span class="verse">2</span> He struck Moab, and measured them with the line, making them to lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death, and one full line to keep alive. The Moabites became servants to David, and brought tribute.   <span class="verse">3</span> David struck also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his dominion at the River.   <span class="verse">4</span> David took from him one thousand seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen. David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.   <span class="verse">5</span> When the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck twenty two thousand men of the Syrians.   <span class="verse">6</span> Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought tribute. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.   <span class="verse">7</span> David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">8</span> From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took a great quantity of bronze.   <span class="verse">9</span> When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had struck all the army of Hadadezer,   <span class="verse">10</span> then Toi sent Joram his son to king David, to greet him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and struck him; for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. Joram brought with him vessels of silver, vessels of gold, and vessels of bronze.   <span class="verse">11</span> King David also dedicated these to Yahweh, with the silver and gold that he dedicated of all the nations which he subdued;   <span class="verse">12</span> of Syria, of Moab, of the children of Ammon, of the Philistines, of Amalek, and of the plunder of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.  <span class="verse">13</span> David earned a reputation when he returned from striking down eighteen thousand men of the Syrians in the Valley of Salt.   <span class="verse">14</span> He put garrisons in Edom. Throughout all Edom, he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. Yahweh gave victory to David wherever he went.   <span class="verse">15</span> David reigned over all Israel; and David executed justice and righteousness for all his people.   <span class="verse">16</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder,   <span class="verse">17</span> Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, Seraiah was scribe,   <span class="verse">18</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David’s sons were chief ministers.   <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> David said, “Is there yet any who is left of Saul’s house, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”   <span class="verse">2</span> There was of Saul’s house a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?”  He said, “I am your servant.”  <span class="verse">3</span> The king said, “Is there not yet any of Saul’s house, that I may show the kindness of God to him?”  Ziba said to the king, “Jonathan still has a son, who is lame in his feet.”  <span class="verse">4</span> The king said to him, “Where is he?”  Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar.   <span class="verse">6</span> Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, “Mephibosheth.”  He answered, “Behold, your servant!”  <span class="verse">7</span> David said to him, “Don’t be afraid; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You will eat bread at my table continually.”  <span class="verse">8</span> He bowed down, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look at such a dead dog as I am?”   <span class="verse">9</span> Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s son.   <span class="verse">10</span> Till the land for him, you, your sons, and your servants. Bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth your master’s son will always eat bread at my table.”  Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.   <span class="verse">11</span> Then Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.” So Mephibosheth ate at the king’s table, like one of the king’s sons.   <span class="verse">12</span> Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Mica. All that lived in Ziba’s house were servants to Mephibosheth.   <span class="verse">13</span> So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem; for he ate continually at the king’s table. He was lame in both his feet.   <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> After this, the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his place.   <span class="verse">2</span> David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness to me.” So David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father. David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.  <span class="verse">3</span> But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Hasn’t David sent his servants to you to search the city, to spy it out, and to overthrow it?”  <span class="verse">4</span> So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved off one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.   <span class="verse">5</span> When they told David this, he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. The king said, “Wait at Jericho until your beards have grown, and then return.”  <span class="verse">6</span> When the children of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth Rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with one thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.   <span class="verse">7</span> When David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the army of the mighty men.   <span class="verse">8</span> The children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate. The Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.   <span class="verse">9</span> Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.   <span class="verse">10</span> The rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the children of Ammon.   <span class="verse">11</span> He said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.   <span class="verse">12</span> Be courageous, and let’s be strong for our people, and for the cities of our God; and may Yahweh do what seems good to him.”   <span class="verse">13</span> So Joab and the people who were with him came near to the battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.   <span class="verse">14</span> When the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">15</span> When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered themselves together.   <span class="verse">16</span> Hadadezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the army of Hadadezer at their head.   <span class="verse">17</span> David was told that; and he gathered all Israel together, passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. The Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.   <span class="verse">18</span> The Syrians fled before Israel; and David killed seven hundred charioteers of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their army, so that he died there.   <span class="verse">19</span> When all the kings who were servants to Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians were afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.
