		<span class="reference">2 Samuel 1-2</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> After the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;   <span class="verse">2</span> on the third day, behold,  a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the earth, and showed respect.  <span class="verse">3</span> David said to him, “Where do you come from?”  He said to him, “I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.”  <span class="verse">4</span> David said to him, “How did it go? Please tell me.”  He answered, “The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead. Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.”  <span class="verse">5</span> David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?”  <span class="verse">6</span> The young man who told him said, “As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed close behind him.   <span class="verse">7</span> When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Here I am.’   <span class="verse">8</span> He said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’   <span class="verse">9</span> He said to me, ‘Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life lingers in me.’   <span class="verse">10</span> So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and all the men who were with him did likewise.   <span class="verse">12</span> They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh,  and for the house of Israel; because they had fallen by the sword.   <span class="verse">13</span> David said to the young man who told him, “Where are you from?”  He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”  <span class="verse">14</span> David said to him, “Why were you not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy Yahweh’s anointed?”   <span class="verse">15</span> David called one of the young men, and said, “Go near, and cut him down!” He struck him so that he died.   <span class="verse">16</span> David said to him, “Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have slain Yahweh’s anointed.’ ”  <span class="verse">17</span> David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son   <span class="verse">18</span> (and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow; behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):  <span class="verse">19</span> “Your glory, Israel, was slain on your high places!  How the mighty have fallen!  <span class="verse">20</span> Don’t tell it in Gath.  Don’t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,  lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,  lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.  <span class="verse">21</span> You mountains of Gilboa,  let there be no dew or rain on you, and no fields of offerings;  For there the shield of the mighty was defiled and cast away,  The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.  <span class="verse">22</span> From the blood of the slain,  from the fat of the mighty,  Jonathan’s bow didn’t turn back.  Saul’s sword didn’t return empty.  <span class="verse">23</span> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.  In their death, they were not divided.  They were swifter than eagles.  They were stronger than lions.  <span class="verse">24</span> You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,  who clothed you delicately in scarlet,  who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.  <span class="verse">25</span> How the mighty have fallen in the middle of the battle!  Jonathan was slain on your high places.  <span class="verse">26</span> I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.  You have been very pleasant to me.  Your love to me was wonderful,  passing the love of women.  <span class="verse">27</span> How the mighty have fallen,  and the weapons of war have perished!”   <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> After this, David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?”  Yahweh said to him, “Go up.”  David said, “Where shall I go up?”  He said, “To Hebron.”  <span class="verse">2</span> So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.   <span class="verse">3</span> David brought up his men who were with him, every man with his household. They lived in the cities of Hebron.   <span class="verse">4</span> The men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. They told David, “The men of Jabesh Gilead were those who buried Saul.”   <span class="verse">5</span> David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and said to them, “Blessed are you by Yahweh, that you have shown this kindness to your lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.   <span class="verse">6</span> Now may Yahweh show loving kindness and truth to you. I also will reward you for this kindness, because you have done this thing.   <span class="verse">7</span> Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s army, had taken Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;   <span class="verse">9</span> and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.   <span class="verse">10</span> Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.   <span class="verse">11</span> The time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.   <span class="verse">12</span> Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.   <span class="verse">13</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah and David’s servants went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.   <span class="verse">14</span> Abner said to Joab, “Please let the young men arise and play before us!”  Joab said, “Let them arise!”   <span class="verse">15</span> Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin and for Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of David’s servants.   <span class="verse">16</span> They each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together: therefore that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim. <span class="verse">17</span> The battle was very severe that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before David’s servants.   <span class="verse">18</span> The three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild gazelle.   <span class="verse">19</span> Asahel pursued Abner; and in going he didn’t turn to the right hand or to the left from following Abner.   <span class="verse">20</span> Then Abner looked behind him, and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”  He answered, “It is.”  <span class="verse">21</span> Abner said to him, “Turn away to your right hand or to your left, and grab one of the young men, and take his armor.” But Asahel would not turn away from following him.   <span class="verse">22</span> Abner said again to Asahel, “Turn away from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I look Joab your brother in the face?”   <span class="verse">23</span> However he refused to turn away. Therefore Abner with the back end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place. As many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.   <span class="verse">24</span> But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. The sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.   <span class="verse">25</span> The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.   <span class="verse">26</span> Then Abner called to Joab, and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Don’t you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long will it be then, before you ask the people to return from following their brothers?”  <span class="verse">27</span> Joab said, “As God  lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people would have gone away, and not each followed his brother.”   <span class="verse">28</span> So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued Israel no more, and they fought no more.   <span class="verse">29</span> Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.   <span class="verse">30</span> Joab returned from following Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen men of David’s and Asahel were missing.   <span class="verse">31</span> But David’s servants had struck Benjamin and of Abner’s men so that three hundred sixty men died.   <span class="verse">32</span> They took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Bethlehem. Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.

Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,  for his loving kindness endures forever.  <span class="verse">2</span> Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh,  or fully declare all his praise?  <span class="verse">3</span> Blessed are those who keep justice.  Blessed is one who does what is right at all times.  <span class="verse">4</span> Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people.  Visit me with your salvation,  <span class="verse">5</span> that I may see the prosperity of your chosen,  that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,  that I may glory with your inheritance.  <span class="verse">6</span> We have sinned with our fathers.  We have committed iniquity.  We have done wickedly.  <span class="verse">7</span> Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt.  They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,  but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.  <span class="verse">8</span> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,  that he might make his mighty power known.  <span class="verse">9</span> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;  so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.  <span class="verse">10</span> He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,  and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.  <span class="verse">11</span> The waters covered their adversaries.  There was not one of them left.  <span class="verse">12</span> Then they believed his words.  They sang his praise.  <span class="verse">13</span> They soon forgot his works.  They didn’t wait for his counsel,  <span class="verse">14</span> but gave in to craving in the desert,  and tested God in the wasteland.  <span class="verse">15</span> He gave them their request,  but sent leanness into their soul.  <span class="verse">16</span> They envied Moses also in the camp,  and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint.  <span class="verse">17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,  and covered the company of Abiram.  <span class="verse">18</span> A fire was kindled in their company.  The flame burned up the wicked.  <span class="verse">19</span> They made a calf in Horeb,  and worshiped a molten image.  <span class="verse">20</span> Thus they exchanged their glory  for an image of a bull that eats grass.  <span class="verse">21</span> They forgot God, their Savior,  who had done great things in Egypt,  <span class="verse">22</span> wondrous works in the land of Ham,  and awesome things by the Red Sea.  <span class="verse">23</span> Therefore he said that he would destroy them,  had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,  to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.

		<span class="reference">2 Corinthians 11:16-33</span>  <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">16</span> I say again, let no one think me foolish. But if so, yet receive me as foolish, that I also may boast a little.   <span class="verse">17</span> That which I speak, I don’t speak according to the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of boasting.   <span class="verse">18</span> Seeing that many boast after the flesh, I will also boast.   <span class="verse">19</span> For you bear with the foolish gladly, being wise.   <span class="verse">20</span> For you bear with a man if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, or if he strikes you on the face.   <span class="verse">21</span> I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet in whatever way anyone is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.   <span class="verse">22</span> Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the offspring  of Abraham? So am I.   <span class="verse">23</span> Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself.) I am more so: in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, and in deaths often.   <span class="verse">24</span> Five times I received forty stripes minus one from the Jews.   <span class="verse">25</span> Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I suffered shipwreck. I have been a night and a day in the deep.   <span class="verse">26</span> I have been in travels often, perils of rivers, perils of robbers, perils from my countrymen, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the wilderness, perils in the sea, perils among false brothers;   <span class="verse">27</span> in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, and in cold and nakedness.  <span class="verse">28</span> Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily: anxiety for all the assemblies.   <span class="verse">29</span> Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I don’t burn with indignation?   <span class="verse">30</span> If I must boast, I will boast of the things that concern my weakness.   <span class="verse">31</span> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, he who is blessed forever more, knows that I don’t lie.   <span class="verse">32</span> In Damascus the governor under King Aretas guarded the Damascenes’ city, desiring to arrest me.   <span class="verse">33</span> I was let down in a basket through a window by the wall, and escaped his hands.
