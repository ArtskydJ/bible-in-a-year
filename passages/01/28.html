		<span class="reference">Genesis 47</span>  <span class="chapter">47</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold, they are in the land of Goshen.”   <span class="verse">2</span> From among his brothers he took five men, and presented them to Pharaoh.   <span class="verse">3</span> Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?”  They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.”   <span class="verse">4</span> They also said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live as foreigners in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.   <span class="verse">6</span> The land of Egypt is before you. Make your father and your brothers dwell in the best of the land. Let them dwell in the land of Goshen. If you know any able men among them, then put them in charge of my livestock.”  <span class="verse">7</span> Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.   <span class="verse">8</span> Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How old are you?”  <span class="verse">9</span> Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are one hundred thirty years. The days of the years of my life have been few and evil. They have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”   <span class="verse">10</span> Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.  <span class="verse">11</span> Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.   <span class="verse">12</span> Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household with bread, according to the sizes of their families.  <span class="verse">13</span> There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.   <span class="verse">14</span> Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.   <span class="verse">15</span> When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence? For our money fails.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Joseph said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your livestock, if your money is gone.”  <span class="verse">17</span> They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.   <span class="verse">18</span> When that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands.   <span class="verse">19</span> Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be desolate.”  <span class="verse">20</span> So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh’s.   <span class="verse">21</span> As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.   <span class="verse">22</span> Only he didn’t buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell their land.   <span class="verse">23</span> Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh. Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land.   <span class="verse">24</span> It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.”  <span class="verse">25</span> They said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”  <span class="verse">26</span> Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t become Pharaoh’s.  <span class="verse">27</span> Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.   <span class="verse">28</span> Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred forty-seven years.   <span class="verse">29</span> The time came near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt,   <span class="verse">30</span> but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.”  Joseph said, “I will do as you have said.”  <span class="verse">31</span> Israel said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself on the bed’s head.

Why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my groaning?  <span class="verse">2</span> My God, I cry in the daytime, but you don’t answer;  in the night season, and am not silent.  <span class="verse">3</span> But you are holy,  you who inhabit the praises of Israel.  <span class="verse">4</span> Our fathers trusted in you.  They trusted, and you delivered them.  <span class="verse">5</span> They cried to you, and were delivered.  They trusted in you, and were not disappointed.  <span class="verse">6</span> But I am a worm, and no man;  a reproach of men, and despised by the people.  <span class="verse">7</span> All those who see me mock me.  They insult me with their lips. They shake their heads, saying,  <span class="verse">8</span> “He trusts in Yahweh.  Let him deliver him.  Let him rescue him, since he delights in him.”  <span class="verse">9</span> But you brought me out of the womb.  You made me trust while at my mother’s breasts.  <span class="verse">10</span> I was thrown on you from my mother’s womb.  You are my God since my mother bore me.  <span class="verse">11</span> Don’t be far from me, for trouble is near.  For there is no one to help.

Your faith has made you well.”  And the woman was made well from that hour.  <span class="verse">23</span> When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder,   <span class="verse">24</span> he said to them,  “Make room, because the girl isn’t dead, but sleeping.” They were ridiculing him.   <span class="verse">25</span> But when the crowd was put out, he entered in, took her by the hand, and the girl arose.   <span class="verse">26</span> The report of this went out into all that land.

Since indeed you thrust it from yourselves, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.   <span class="verse">47</span> For so has the Lord commanded us, saying,  ‘I have set you as a light for the Gentiles,  that you should bring salvation to the uttermost parts of the earth.’ ”  <span class="verse">48</span> As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of God. As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.   <span class="verse">49</span> The Lord’s word was spread abroad throughout all the region.   <span class="verse">50</span> But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.   <span class="verse">51</span> But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.   <span class="verse">52</span> The disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
