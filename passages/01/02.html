		<span class="reference">Genesis 3-4</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, “Has God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?”  <span class="verse">2</span> The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden,   <span class="verse">3</span> but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you die.’ ”  <span class="verse">4</span> The serpent said to the woman, “You won’t really die,   <span class="verse">5</span> for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”  <span class="verse">6</span> When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate it, too.   <span class="verse">7</span> Their eyes were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.   <span class="verse">8</span> They heard Yahweh God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.  <span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”  <span class="verse">10</span> The man said, “I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; so I hid myself.”  <span class="verse">11</span> God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”  <span class="verse">12</span> The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh God said to the woman, “What have you done?”  The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”  <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh God said to the serpent,  “Because you have done this,  you are cursed above all livestock,  and above every animal of the field.  You shall go on your belly  and you shall eat dust all the days of your life.  <span class="verse">15</span> I will put hostility between you and the woman,  and between your offspring and her offspring.  He will bruise your head,  and you will bruise his heel.”  <span class="verse">16</span> To the woman he said,  “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.  You will bear children in pain.  Your desire will be for your husband,  and he will rule over you.”  <span class="verse">17</span> To Adam he said,  “Because you have listened to your wife’s voice,  and ate from the tree,  about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it,’  the ground is cursed for your sake.  You will eat from it with much labor all the days of your life.  <span class="verse">18</span> It will yield thorns and thistles to you;  and you will eat the herb of the field.  <span class="verse">19</span> You will eat bread by the sweat of your face until you return to the ground,  for you were taken out of it.  For you are dust,  and you shall return to dust.”  <span class="verse">20</span> The man called his wife Eve because she would be the mother of all the living.   <span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh God made garments of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed them.  <span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—”   <span class="verse">23</span> Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.   <span class="verse">24</span> So he drove out the man; and he placed cherubim  at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.   <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> The man knew  Eve his wife. She conceived,  and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I have gotten a man with Yahweh’s help.”   <span class="verse">2</span> Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.   <span class="verse">3</span> As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.   <span class="verse">4</span> Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,   <span class="verse">5</span> but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell.   <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?   <span class="verse">7</span> If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.”   <span class="verse">8</span> Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.  <span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh said to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?”  He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me from the ground.   <span class="verse">11</span> Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.   <span class="verse">12</span> From now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment is greater than I can bear.   <span class="verse">14</span> Behold, you have driven me out today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me will kill me.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh said to him, “Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone finding him would not strike him.  <span class="verse">16</span> Cain left Yahweh’s presence, and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.   <span class="verse">17</span> Cain knew his wife. She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the name of his son, Enoch.   <span class="verse">18</span> Irad was born to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech.   <span class="verse">19</span> Lamech took two wives: the name of the first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah.   <span class="verse">20</span> Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock.   <span class="verse">21</span> His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the father of all who handle the harp and pipe.   <span class="verse">22</span> Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.   <span class="verse">23</span> Lamech said to his wives,  “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.  You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech,  for I have slain a man for wounding me,  a young man for bruising me.  <span class="verse">24</span> If Cain will be avenged seven times,  truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”  <span class="verse">25</span> Adam knew his wife again. She gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.”   <span class="verse">26</span> A son was also born to Seth, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on Yahweh’s name.

The Lord  will have them in derision.  <span class="verse">5</span> Then he will speak to them in his anger,  and terrify them in his wrath:  <span class="verse">6</span> “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”  <span class="verse">7</span> I will tell of the decree:  Yahweh said to me, “You are my son.  Today I have become your father.  <span class="verse">8</span> Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,  the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.  <span class="verse">9</span> You shall break them with a rod of iron.  You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Now therefore be wise, you kings.  Be instructed, you judges of the earth.  <span class="verse">11</span> Serve Yahweh with fear,  and rejoice with trembling.  <span class="verse">12</span> Give sincere homage to the Son,  lest he be angry, and you perish on the way,  for his wrath will soon be kindled.  Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.

You shall name him Jesus,  for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”  <span class="verse">22</span> Now all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,  <span class="verse">23</span> “Behold, the virgin shall be with child,  and shall give birth to a son.  They shall call his name Immanuel;”  which is, being interpreted, “God with us.” <span class="verse">24</span> Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;   <span class="verse">25</span> and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.

		<span class="reference">Acts 1:12-26</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">12</span> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.   <span class="verse">13</span> When they had come in, they went up into the upper room where they were staying; that is Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.   <span class="verse">14</span> All these with one accord continued steadfastly in prayer and supplication, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.  <span class="verse">15</span> In these days, Peter stood up in the middle of the disciples (and the number of names was about one hundred twenty), and said,   <span class="verse">16</span> “Brothers, it was necessary that this Scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who was guide to those who took Jesus.   <span class="verse">17</span> For he was counted with us, and received his portion in this ministry.   <span class="verse">18</span> Now this man obtained a field with the reward for his wickedness, and falling headlong, his body burst open, and all his intestines gushed out.   <span class="verse">19</span> It became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ‘Akeldama,’ that is, ‘The field of blood.’   <span class="verse">20</span> For it is written in the book of Psalms,  ‘Let his habitation be made desolate.  Let no one dwell in it;’ and,  ‘Let another take his office.’ <span class="verse">21</span> “Of the men therefore who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,   <span class="verse">22</span> beginning from the baptism of John, to the day that he was received up from us, of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”  <span class="verse">23</span> They put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.   <span class="verse">24</span> They prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen   <span class="verse">25</span> to take part in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.”   <span class="verse">26</span> They drew lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was counted with the eleven apostles.
