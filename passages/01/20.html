		<span class="reference">Genesis 37</span>  <span class="chapter">37</span><span class="verse">1</span> Jacob lived in the land of his father’s travels, in the land of Canaan.   <span class="verse">2</span> This is the history of the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.   <span class="verse">3</span> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a tunic of many colors.   <span class="verse">4</span> His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn’t speak peaceably to him.  <span class="verse">5</span> Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more.   <span class="verse">6</span> He said to them, “Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:   <span class="verse">7</span> for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to my sheaf.”  <span class="verse">8</span> His brothers asked him, “Will you indeed reign over us? Will you indeed have dominion over us?” They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words.   <span class="verse">9</span> He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream: and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.”   <span class="verse">10</span> He told it to his father and to his brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth?”   <span class="verse">11</span> His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.  <span class="verse">12</span> His brothers went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.   <span class="verse">13</span> Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.”  <span class="verse">14</span> He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.   <span class="verse">15</span> A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, “What are you looking for?”  <span class="verse">16</span> He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.”  <span class="verse">17</span> The man said, “They have left here, for I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’ ”  Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan.   <span class="verse">18</span> They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to kill him.   <span class="verse">19</span> They said to one another, “Behold, this dreamer comes.   <span class="verse">20</span> Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil animal has devoured him.’ We will see what will become of his dreams.”  <span class="verse">21</span> Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his life.”   <span class="verse">22</span> Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him”—that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.   <span class="verse">23</span> When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him;   <span class="verse">24</span> and they took him, and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.  <span class="verse">25</span> They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.   <span class="verse">26</span> Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?   <span class="verse">27</span> Come, and let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh.” His brothers listened to him.   <span class="verse">28</span> Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. The merchants brought Joseph into Egypt.  <span class="verse">29</span> Reuben returned to the pit, and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore his clothes.   <span class="verse">30</span> He returned to his brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?”   <span class="verse">31</span> They took Joseph’s tunic, and killed a male goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood.   <span class="verse">32</span> They took the tunic of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found this. Examine it, now, and see if it is your son’s tunic or not.”  <span class="verse">33</span> He recognized it, and said, “It is my son’s tunic. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.”   <span class="verse">34</span> Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many days.   <span class="verse">35</span> All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He said, “For I will go down to Sheol  to my son, mourning.” His father wept for him.   <span class="verse">36</span> The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.

Let your eyes look on equity.  <span class="verse">3</span> You have proved my heart.  You have visited me in the night.  You have tried me, and found nothing.  I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.  <span class="verse">4</span> As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips,  I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.  <span class="verse">5</span> My steps have held fast to your paths.  My feet have not slipped.  <span class="verse">6</span> I have called on you, for you will answer me, God.  Turn your ear to me.  Hear my speech.  <span class="verse">7</span> Show your marvelous loving kindness,  you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies.  <span class="verse">8</span> Keep me as the apple of your eye.  Hide me under the shadow of your wings,  <span class="verse">9</span> from the wicked who oppress me,  my deadly enemies, who surround me.  <span class="verse">10</span> They close up their callous hearts.  With their mouth they speak proudly.  <span class="verse">11</span> They have now surrounded us in our steps.  They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.  <span class="verse">12</span> He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,  as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.  <span class="verse">13</span> Arise, Yahweh, confront him.  Cast him down.  Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword;  <span class="verse">14</span> from men by your hand, Yahweh,  from men of the world, whose portion is in this life.  You fill the belly of your cherished ones.  Your sons have plenty,  and they store up wealth for their children.  <span class="verse">15</span> As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness.  I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing your form.

First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye. <span class="verse">6</span> “Don’t give that which is holy to the dogs, neither throw your pearls before the pigs, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces. <span class="verse">7</span> “Ask, and it will be given you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and it will be opened for you.  <span class="verse">8</span> For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened.  <span class="verse">9</span> Or who is there among you, who, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?  <span class="verse">10</span> Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?  <span class="verse">11</span> If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!  <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.

		<span class="reference">Acts 10:24-48</span>  <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">24</span> On the next day they entered into Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and his near friends.   <span class="verse">25</span> When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.   <span class="verse">26</span> But Peter raised him up, saying, “Stand up! I myself am also a man.”   <span class="verse">27</span> As he talked with him, he went in and found many gathered together.   <span class="verse">28</span> He said to them, “You yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to join himself or come to one of another nation, but God has shown me that I shouldn’t call any man unholy or unclean.   <span class="verse">29</span> Therefore I also came without complaint when I was sent for. I ask therefore, why did you send for me?”  <span class="verse">30</span> Cornelius said, “Four days ago, I was fasting until this hour, and at the ninth hour,  I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,   <span class="verse">31</span> and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your gifts to the needy are remembered in the sight of God.   <span class="verse">32</span> Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is also called Peter. He is staying in the house of a tanner named Simon, by the seaside. When he comes, he will speak to you.’   <span class="verse">33</span> Therefore I sent to you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God.”  <span class="verse">34</span> Peter opened his mouth and said, “Truly I perceive that God doesn’t show favoritism;   <span class="verse">35</span> but in every nation he who fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.   <span class="verse">36</span> The word which he sent to the children of Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ—he is Lord of all—   <span class="verse">37</span> you yourselves know what happened, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;   <span class="verse">38</span> even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.   <span class="verse">39</span> We are witnesses of everything he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they also  killed, hanging him on a tree.   <span class="verse">40</span> God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,   <span class="verse">41</span> not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.   <span class="verse">42</span> He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead.   <span class="verse">43</span> All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins.”  <span class="verse">44</span> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.   <span class="verse">45</span> They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles.   <span class="verse">46</span> For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God.  Then Peter answered,   <span class="verse">47</span> “Can anyone forbid these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just like us.”   <span class="verse">48</span> He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay some days.
