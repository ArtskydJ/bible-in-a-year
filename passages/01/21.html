		<span class="reference">Genesis 38</span>  <span class="chapter">38</span><span class="verse">1</span> At that time, Judah went down from his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.   <span class="verse">2</span> There, Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite man named Shua. He took her, and went in to her.   <span class="verse">3</span> She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er.   <span class="verse">4</span> She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.   <span class="verse">5</span> She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore him.   <span class="verse">6</span> Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.   <span class="verse">7</span> Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in Yahweh’s sight. So Yahweh killed him.   <span class="verse">8</span> Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up offspring for your brother.”   <span class="verse">9</span> Onan knew that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother.   <span class="verse">10</span> The thing which he did was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and he killed him also.   <span class="verse">11</span> Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;” for he said, “Lest he also die, like his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.  <span class="verse">12</span> After many days, Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.   <span class="verse">13</span> Tamar was told, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”   <span class="verse">14</span> She took off the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife.   <span class="verse">15</span> When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.   <span class="verse">16</span> He turned to her by the way, and said, “Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law.  She said, “What will you give me, that you may come in to me?”  <span class="verse">17</span> He said, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.”  She said, “Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?”  <span class="verse">18</span> He said, “What pledge will I give you?”  She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.”  He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.   <span class="verse">19</span> She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.   <span class="verse">20</span> Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her.   <span class="verse">21</span> Then he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?”  They said, “There has been no prostitute here.”  <span class="verse">22</span> He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’ ”   <span class="verse">23</span> Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.”  <span class="verse">24</span> About three months later, Judah was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute. Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.”  Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned.”   <span class="verse">25</span> When she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose these are—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.”  <span class="verse">26</span> Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.”  He knew her again no more.   <span class="verse">27</span> In the time of her travail, behold, twins were in her womb.   <span class="verse">28</span> When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, “This came out first.”   <span class="verse">29</span> As he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for yourself?” Therefore his name was called Perez. <span class="verse">30</span> Afterward his brother came out, who had the scarlet thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.

The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.  <span class="verse">5</span> The cords of Sheol  were around me.  The snares of death came on me.  <span class="verse">6</span> In my distress I called on Yahweh,  and cried to my God.  He heard my voice out of his temple.  My cry before him came into his ears.  <span class="verse">7</span> Then the earth shook and trembled.  The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken,  because he was angry.  <span class="verse">8</span> Smoke went out of his nostrils.  Consuming fire came out of his mouth.  Coals were kindled by it.  <span class="verse">9</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came down.  Thick darkness was under his feet.  <span class="verse">10</span> He rode on a cherub, and flew.  Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.  <span class="verse">11</span> He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,  darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.  <span class="verse">12</span> At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,  hailstones and coals of fire.

		<span class="reference">Acts 11:1-18</span>  <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now the apostles and the brothers  who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.   <span class="verse">2</span> When Peter had come up to Jerusalem, those who were of the circumcision contended with him,   <span class="verse">3</span> saying, “You went in to uncircumcised men, and ate with them!”  <span class="verse">4</span> But Peter began, and explained to them in order, saying,   <span class="verse">5</span> “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: a certain container descending, like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners. It came as far as me.   <span class="verse">6</span> When I had looked intently at it, I considered, and saw the four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, creeping things, and birds of the sky.   <span class="verse">7</span> I also heard a voice saying to me,  ‘Rise, Peter, kill and eat!’  <span class="verse">8</span> But I said, ‘Not so, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.’   <span class="verse">9</span> But a voice answered me the second time out of heaven,  ‘What God has cleansed, don’t you call unclean.’ <span class="verse">10</span> This was done three times, and all were drawn up again into heaven.   <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, immediately three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.   <span class="verse">12</span> The Spirit told me to go with them, without discriminating. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house.   <span class="verse">13</span> He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying to him, ‘Send to Joppa, and get Simon, who is called Peter,   <span class="verse">14</span> who will speak to you words by which you will be saved, you and all your house.’   <span class="verse">15</span> As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.   <span class="verse">16</span> I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said,  ‘John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.’ <span class="verse">17</span> If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?”  <span class="verse">18</span> When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, “Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life!”
