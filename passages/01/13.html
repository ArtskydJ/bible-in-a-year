		<span class="reference">Genesis 25-26</span>  <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">1</span> Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.   <span class="verse">2</span> She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.   <span class="verse">3</span> Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.   <span class="verse">4</span> The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.   <span class="verse">5</span> Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,   <span class="verse">6</span> but Abraham gave gifts to the sons of Abraham’s concubines. While he still lived, he sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward, to the east country.   <span class="verse">7</span> These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.   <span class="verse">8</span> Abraham gave up his spirit, and died at a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.   <span class="verse">9</span> Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is near Mamre,   <span class="verse">10</span> the field which Abraham purchased from the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.   <span class="verse">11</span> After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.  <span class="verse">12</span> Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.   <span class="verse">13</span> These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,   <span class="verse">14</span> Mishma, Dumah, Massa,   <span class="verse">15</span> Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.   <span class="verse">16</span> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.   <span class="verse">17</span> These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up his spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.   <span class="verse">18</span> They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.  <span class="verse">19</span> This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.   <span class="verse">20</span> Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.   <span class="verse">21</span> Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.   <span class="verse">22</span> The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh.   <span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh said to her,  “Two nations are in your womb.  Two peoples will be separated from your body.  The one people will be stronger than the other people.  The elder will serve the younger.”  <span class="verse">24</span> When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.   <span class="verse">25</span> The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.   <span class="verse">26</span> After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.  <span class="verse">27</span> The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.   <span class="verse">28</span> Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.   <span class="verse">29</span> Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.   <span class="verse">30</span> Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom. <span class="verse">31</span> Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”  <span class="verse">32</span> Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”  <span class="verse">33</span> Jacob said, “Swear to me first.”  He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.   <span class="verse">34</span> Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.   <span class="chapter">26</span><span class="verse">1</span> There was a famine in the land, in addition to the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar.   <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I will tell you about.   <span class="verse">3</span> Live in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.   <span class="verse">4</span> I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed,   <span class="verse">5</span> because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Isaac lived in Gerar.   <span class="verse">7</span> The men of the place asked him about his wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”, lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah, because she is beautiful to look at.”   <span class="verse">8</span> When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.   <span class="verse">9</span> Abimelech called Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’ ”  Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because of her.’ ”  <span class="verse">10</span> Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”  <span class="verse">11</span> Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. Yahweh blessed him.   <span class="verse">13</span> The man grew great, and grew more and more until he became very great.   <span class="verse">14</span> He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The Philistines envied him.   <span class="verse">15</span> Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.   <span class="verse">16</span> Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, for you are much mightier than we.”  <span class="verse">17</span> Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived there.  <span class="verse">18</span> Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their names after the names by which his father had called them.   <span class="verse">19</span> Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.   <span class="verse">20</span> The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” He called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.   <span class="verse">21</span> They dug another well, and they argued over that, also. He called its name Sitnah.   <span class="verse">22</span> He left that place, and dug another well. They didn’t argue over that one. He called it Rehoboth. He said, “For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.”  <span class="verse">23</span> He went up from there to Beersheba.   <span class="verse">24</span> Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, “I am the God of Abraham your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your offspring for my servant Abraham’s sake.”  <span class="verse">25</span> He built an altar there, and called on Yahweh’s name, and pitched his tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well.  <span class="verse">26</span> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.   <span class="verse">27</span> Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?”  <span class="verse">28</span> They said, “We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you. We said, ‘Let there now be an oath between us, even between us and you, and let’s make a covenant with you,   <span class="verse">29</span> that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">30</span> He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.   <span class="verse">31</span> They rose up some time in the morning, and swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.   <span class="verse">32</span> The same day, Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him, “We have found water.”   <span class="verse">33</span> He called it “Shibah”.  Therefore the name of the city is “Beersheba”  to this day.  <span class="verse">34</span> When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite.   <span class="verse">35</span> They grieved Isaac’s and Rebekah’s spirits.

You consider it to take it into your hand.  You help the victim and the fatherless.  <span class="verse">15</span> Break the arm of the wicked.

It is then good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under the feet of men.  <span class="verse">14</span> You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can’t be hidden.  <span class="verse">15</span> Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a measuring basket, but on a stand; and it shines to all who are in the house.  <span class="verse">16</span> Even so, let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. <span class="verse">17</span> “Don’t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I didn’t come to destroy, but to fulfill.  <span class="verse">18</span> For most certainly, I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not even one smallest letter or one tiny pen stroke shall in any way pass away from the law, until all things are accomplished.  <span class="verse">19</span> Whoever, therefore, shall break one of these least commandments, and teach others to do so, shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.  <span class="verse">20</span> For I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

		<span class="reference">Acts 7:17-36</span>  <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">17</span> “But as the time of the promise came close which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,   <span class="verse">18</span> until there arose a different king, who didn’t know Joseph.   <span class="verse">19</span> The same took advantage of our race, and mistreated our fathers, and forced them to throw out their babies, so that they wouldn’t stay alive.   <span class="verse">20</span> At that time Moses was born, and was exceedingly handsome. He was nourished three months in his father’s house.   <span class="verse">21</span> When he was thrown out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up and reared him as her own son.   <span class="verse">22</span> Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was mighty in his words and works.   <span class="verse">23</span> But when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers,  the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">24</span> Seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian.   <span class="verse">25</span> He supposed that his brothers understood that God, by his hand, was giving them deliverance; but they didn’t understand.  <span class="verse">26</span> “The day following, he appeared to them as they fought, and urged them to be at peace again, saying, ‘Sirs, you are brothers. Why do you wrong one another?’   <span class="verse">27</span> But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?   <span class="verse">28</span> Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ <span class="verse">29</span> Moses fled at this saying, and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.  <span class="verse">30</span> “When forty years were fulfilled, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.   <span class="verse">31</span> When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight. As he came close to see, a voice of the Lord came to him,   <span class="verse">32</span> ‘I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’  Moses trembled, and dared not look.   <span class="verse">33</span> The Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, for the place where you stand is holy ground.   <span class="verse">34</span> I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you into Egypt.’ <span class="verse">35</span> “This Moses, whom they refused, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and a judge?’—God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.   <span class="verse">36</span> This man led them out, having worked wonders and signs in Egypt, in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.
