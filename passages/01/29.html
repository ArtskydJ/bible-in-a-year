		<span class="reference">Genesis 48</span>  <span class="chapter">48</span><span class="verse">1</span> After these things, someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.   <span class="verse">2</span> Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.   <span class="verse">3</span> Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,   <span class="verse">4</span> and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’   <span class="verse">5</span> Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.   <span class="verse">6</span> Your offspring, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.   <span class="verse">7</span> As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).”  <span class="verse">8</span> Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?”  <span class="verse">9</span> Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.”  He said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”   <span class="verse">10</span> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.   <span class="verse">11</span> Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.”   <span class="verse">12</span> Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.   <span class="verse">13</span> Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.   <span class="verse">14</span> Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.   <span class="verse">15</span> He blessed Joseph, and said,  “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,  the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,  <span class="verse">16</span> the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads,  and let my name be named on them,  and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac.  Let them grow into a multitude upon the earth.”  <span class="verse">17</span> When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.   <span class="verse">18</span> Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”  <span class="verse">19</span> His father refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.”   <span class="verse">20</span> He blessed them that day, saying, “Israel will bless in you, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh’ ” He set Ephraim before Manasseh.   <span class="verse">21</span> Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.   <span class="verse">22</span> Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.”

Jesus said to them,  “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They told him, “Yes, Lord.”  <span class="verse">29</span> Then he touched their eyes, saying,  “According to your faith be it done to you.” <span class="verse">30</span> Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly commanded them, saying,  “See that no one knows about this.” <span class="verse">31</span> But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land.  <span class="verse">32</span> As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him.   <span class="verse">33</span> When the demon was cast out, the mute man spoke. The multitudes marveled, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”  <span class="verse">34</span> But the Pharisees said, “By the prince of the demons, he casts out demons.”  <span class="verse">35</span> Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.   <span class="verse">36</span> But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed  and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd.   <span class="verse">37</span> Then he said to his disciples,  “The harvest indeed is plentiful, but the laborers are few.  <span class="verse">38</span> Pray therefore that the Lord of the harvest will send out laborers into his harvest.”

		<span class="reference">Acts 14</span>  <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> In Iconium, they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.   <span class="verse">2</span> But the disbelieving  Jews stirred up and embittered the souls of the Gentiles against the brothers.   <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who testified to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.   <span class="verse">4</span> But the multitude of the city was divided. Part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.   <span class="verse">5</span> When some of both the Gentiles and the Jews, with their rulers, made a violent attempt to mistreat and stone them,   <span class="verse">6</span> they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, Derbe, and the surrounding region.   <span class="verse">7</span> There they preached the Good News.  <span class="verse">8</span> At Lystra a certain man sat, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked.   <span class="verse">9</span> He was listening to Paul speaking, who, fastening eyes on him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole,   <span class="verse">10</span> said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” He leaped up and walked.   <span class="verse">11</span> When the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the language of Lycaonia, “The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!”   <span class="verse">12</span> They called Barnabas “Jupiter”, and Paul “Mercury”, because he was the chief speaker.   <span class="verse">13</span> The priest of Jupiter, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have made a sacrifice along with the multitudes.   <span class="verse">14</span> But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they tore their clothes, and sprang into the multitude, crying out,   <span class="verse">15</span> “Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and all that is in them;   <span class="verse">16</span> who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.   <span class="verse">17</span> Yet he didn’t leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you  rains from the sky and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.”  <span class="verse">18</span> Even saying these things, they hardly stopped the multitudes from making a sacrifice to them.   <span class="verse">19</span> But some Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.  <span class="verse">20</span> But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city. On the next day he went out with Barnabas to Derbe.   <span class="verse">21</span> When they had preached the Good News to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,   <span class="verse">22</span> strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many afflictions we must enter into God’s Kingdom.   <span class="verse">23</span> When they had appointed elders for them in every assembly, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.  <span class="verse">24</span> They passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.   <span class="verse">25</span> When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.   <span class="verse">26</span> From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.   <span class="verse">27</span> When they had arrived, and had gathered the assembly together, they reported all the things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.   <span class="verse">28</span> They stayed there with the disciples for a long time.
