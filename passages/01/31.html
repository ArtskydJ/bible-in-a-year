		<span class="reference">Genesis 50</span>  <span class="chapter">50</span><span class="verse">1</span> Joseph fell on his father’s face, wept on him, and kissed him.   <span class="verse">2</span> Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.   <span class="verse">3</span> Forty days were used for him, for that is how many the days it takes to embalm. The Egyptians wept for Israel for seventy days.  <span class="verse">4</span> When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s staff, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,   <span class="verse">5</span> ‘My father made me swear, saying, “Behold, I am dying. Bury me in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father, and I will come again.’ ”  <span class="verse">6</span> Pharaoh said, “Go up, and bury your father, just like he made you swear.”  <span class="verse">7</span> Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all the elders of the land of Egypt,   <span class="verse">8</span> All the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s house. Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.   <span class="verse">9</span> There went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company.   <span class="verse">10</span> They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and severe lamentation. He mourned for his father seven days.   <span class="verse">11</span> When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore its name was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.   <span class="verse">12</span> His sons did to him just as he commanded them,   <span class="verse">13</span> for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, as a possession for a burial site, from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre.   <span class="verse">14</span> Joseph returned into Egypt—he, and his brothers, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.  <span class="verse">15</span> When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us back for all the evil which we did to him.”   <span class="verse">16</span> They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded before he died, saying,   <span class="verse">17</span> ‘You shall tell Joseph, “Now please forgive the disobedience of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you.” ’ Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him.   <span class="verse">18</span> His brothers also went and fell down before his face; and they said, “Behold, we are your servants.”   <span class="verse">19</span> Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid, for am I in the place of God?   <span class="verse">20</span> As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to save many people alive, as is happening today.   <span class="verse">21</span> Now therefore don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.” He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.  <span class="verse">22</span> Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father’s house. Joseph lived one hundred ten years.   <span class="verse">23</span> Joseph saw Ephraim’s children to the third generation. The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born on Joseph’s knees.   <span class="verse">24</span> Joseph said to his brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.”   <span class="verse">25</span> Joseph took an oath from the children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.”   <span class="verse">26</span> So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.  <span class="verse">22</span> You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.  <span class="verse">23</span> But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man has come. <span class="verse">24</span> “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.  <span class="verse">25</span> It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!  <span class="verse">26</span> Therefore don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.  <span class="verse">27</span> What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.  <span class="verse">28</span> Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna. <span class="verse">29</span> “Aren’t two sparrows sold for an assarion coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father’s will,  <span class="verse">30</span> but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.  <span class="verse">31</span> Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.

As it is written,  <span class="verse">16</span> ‘After these things I will return.  I will again build the tabernacle of David, which has fallen.  I will again build its ruins.  I will set it up   <span class="verse">17</span> that the rest of men may seek after the Lord;  all the Gentiles who are called by my name,  says the Lord, who does all these things.’ <span class="verse">18</span> “All of God’s works are known to him from eternity.   <span class="verse">19</span> Therefore my judgment is that we don’t trouble those from among the Gentiles who turn to God,   <span class="verse">20</span> but that we write to them that they abstain from the pollution of idols, from sexual immorality, from what is strangled, and from blood.   <span class="verse">21</span> For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”
