		<span class="reference">Genesis 49</span>  <span class="chapter">49</span><span class="verse">1</span> Jacob called to his sons, and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come.  <span class="verse">2</span> Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob.  Listen to Israel, your father.  <span class="verse">3</span> “Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength;  excelling in dignity, and excelling in power.  <span class="verse">4</span> Boiling over like water, you shall not excel;  because you went up to your father’s bed,  then defiled it. He went up to my couch.  <span class="verse">5</span> “Simeon and Levi are brothers.  Their swords are weapons of violence.  <span class="verse">6</span> My soul, don’t come into their council.  My glory, don’t be united to their assembly;  for in their anger they killed men.  In their self-will they hamstrung cattle.  <span class="verse">7</span> Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;  and their wrath, for it was cruel.  I will divide them in Jacob,  and scatter them in Israel.  <span class="verse">8</span> “Judah, your brothers will praise you.  Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.  Your father’s sons will bow down before you.  <span class="verse">9</span> Judah is a lion’s cub.  From the prey, my son, you have gone up.  He stooped down, he crouched as a lion,  as a lioness.  Who will rouse him up?  <span class="verse">10</span> The scepter will not depart from Judah,  nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,  until he comes to whom it belongs.  To him will the obedience of the peoples be.  <span class="verse">11</span> Binding his foal to the vine,  his donkey’s colt to the choice vine;  he has washed his garments in wine,  his robes in the blood of grapes.  <span class="verse">12</span> His eyes will be red with wine,  his teeth white with milk.  <span class="verse">13</span> “Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea.  He will be for a haven of ships.  His border will be on Sidon.  <span class="verse">14</span> “Issachar is a strong donkey,  lying down between the saddlebags.  <span class="verse">15</span> He saw a resting place, that it was good,  the land, that it was pleasant.  He bows his shoulder to the burden,  and becomes a servant doing forced labor.  <span class="verse">16</span> “Dan will judge his people,  as one of the tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse">17</span> Dan will be a serpent on the trail,  an adder in the path,  that bites the horse’s heels,  so that his rider falls backward.  <span class="verse">18</span> I have waited for your salvation, Yahweh.  <span class="verse">19</span> “A troop will press on Gad,  but he will press on their heel.  <span class="verse">20</span> “Asher’s food will be rich.  He will produce royal dainties.  <span class="verse">21</span> “Naphtali is a doe set free,  who bears beautiful fawns.  <span class="verse">22</span> “Joseph is a fruitful vine,  a fruitful vine by a spring.  His branches run over the wall.  <span class="verse">23</span> The archers have severely grieved him,  shot at him, and persecuted him:  <span class="verse">24</span> But his bow remained strong.  The arms of his hands were made strong,  by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,  (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),  <span class="verse">25</span> even by the God of your father, who will help you,  by the Almighty, who will bless you,  with blessings of heaven above,  blessings of the deep that lies below,  blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.  <span class="verse">26</span> The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings of your ancestors,  above the boundaries of the ancient hills.  They will be on the head of Joseph,  on the crown of the head of him who is separated from his brothers.  <span class="verse">27</span> “Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.  In the morning he will devour the prey.  At evening he will divide the plunder.”  <span class="verse">28</span> All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke to them, and blessed them. He blessed everyone according to his own blessing.   <span class="verse">29</span> He instructed them, and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,   <span class="verse">30</span> in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.   <span class="verse">31</span> There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah:   <span class="verse">32</span> the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.”   <span class="verse">33</span> When Jacob finished charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, breathed his last breath, and was gathered to his people.

Among the assembly, I will praise you.  <span class="verse">23</span> You who fear Yahweh, praise him!  All you descendants of Jacob, glorify him!  Stand in awe of him, all you descendants of Israel!  <span class="verse">24</span> For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,  Neither has he hidden his face from him;  but when he cried to him, he heard.  <span class="verse">25</span> My praise of you comes in the great assembly.  I will pay my vows before those who fear him.  <span class="verse">26</span> The humble shall eat and be satisfied.  They shall praise Yahweh who seek after him.  Let your hearts live forever.  <span class="verse">27</span> All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to Yahweh.  All the relatives of the nations shall worship before you.  <span class="verse">28</span> For the kingdom is Yahweh’s.  He is the ruler over the nations.  <span class="verse">29</span> All the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship.

Future generations shall be told about the Lord.  <span class="verse">31</span> They shall come and shall declare his righteousness to a people that shall be born,  for he has done it.

		<span class="reference">Matthew 10:1-20</span>  <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.   <span class="verse">2</span> Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;   <span class="verse">3</span> Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called  Thaddaeus;   <span class="verse">4</span> Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.  <span class="verse">5</span> Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying,  “Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans.  <span class="verse">6</span> Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse">7</span> As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’  <span class="verse">8</span> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.  <span class="verse">9</span> Don’t take any gold, silver, or brass in your money belts.  <span class="verse">10</span> Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor sandals, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.  <span class="verse">11</span> Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.  <span class="verse">12</span> As you enter into the household, greet it.  <span class="verse">13</span> If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn’t worthy, let your peace return to you.  <span class="verse">14</span> Whoever doesn’t receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet.  <span class="verse">15</span> Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city. <span class="verse">16</span> “Behold, I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.  <span class="verse">17</span> But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.  <span class="verse">18</span> Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.  <span class="verse">19</span> But when they deliver you up, don’t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.  <span class="verse">20</span> For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.

		<span class="reference">Acts 15:1-11</span>  <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> Some men came down from Judea and taught the brothers,  “Unless you are circumcised after the custom of Moses, you can’t be saved.”   <span class="verse">2</span> Therefore when Paul and Barnabas had no small discord and discussion with them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.   <span class="verse">3</span> They, being sent on their way by the assembly, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles. They caused great joy to all the brothers.   <span class="verse">4</span> When they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly and the apostles and the elders, and they reported everything that God had done with them.  <span class="verse">5</span> But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, “It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.”  <span class="verse">6</span> The apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter.   <span class="verse">7</span> When there had been much discussion, Peter rose up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News and believe.   <span class="verse">8</span> God, who knows the heart, testified about them, giving them the Holy Spirit, just like he did to us.   <span class="verse">9</span> He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.   <span class="verse">10</span> Now therefore why do you tempt God, that you should put a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?   <span class="verse">11</span> But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus,   just as they are.”
