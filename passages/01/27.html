Don’t be afraid to go down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation.   <span class="verse">4</span> I will go down with you into Egypt. I will also surely bring you up again. Joseph’s hand will close your eyes.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob, their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.   <span class="verse">6</span> They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt—Jacob, and all his offspring with him,   <span class="verse">7</span> his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and he brought all his offspring with him into Egypt.  <span class="verse">8</span> These are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.   <span class="verse">9</span> The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.   <span class="verse">10</span> The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.   <span class="verse">11</span> The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.   <span class="verse">12</span> The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.   <span class="verse">13</span> The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.   <span class="verse">14</span> The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.   <span class="verse">15</span> These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, with his daughter Dinah. All the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.   <span class="verse">16</span> The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.   <span class="verse">17</span> The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.   <span class="verse">18</span> These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls.   <span class="verse">19</span> The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.   <span class="verse">20</span> To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him.   <span class="verse">21</span> The sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.   <span class="verse">22</span> These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.   <span class="verse">23</span> The son of Dan: Hushim.   <span class="verse">24</span> The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.   <span class="verse">25</span> These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob: all the souls were seven.   <span class="verse">26</span> All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his direct offspring, in addition to Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were sixty-six.   <span class="verse">27</span> The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.  <span class="verse">28</span> Jacob sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.   <span class="verse">29</span> Joseph prepared his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.   <span class="verse">30</span> Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.”  <span class="verse">31</span> Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father’s house, “I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.   <span class="verse">32</span> These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.’   <span class="verse">33</span> It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say, ‘What is your occupation?’   <span class="verse">34</span> that you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:’ that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination to the Egyptians.”

How greatly he rejoices in your salvation!  <span class="verse">2</span> You have given him his heart’s desire,  and have not withheld the request of his lips.  <span class="verse">3</span> For you meet him with the blessings of goodness.  You set a crown of fine gold on his head.  <span class="verse">4</span> He asked life of you and you gave it to him,  even length of days forever and ever.  <span class="verse">5</span> His glory is great in your salvation.  You lay honor and majesty on him.  <span class="verse">6</span> For you make him most blessed forever.  You make him glad with joy in your presence.  <span class="verse">7</span> For the king trusts in Yahweh.  Through the loving kindness of the Most High, he shall not be moved.  <span class="verse">8</span> Your hand will find out all of your enemies.  Your right hand will find out those who hate you.  <span class="verse">9</span> You will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger.  Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath.  The fire shall devour them.  <span class="verse">10</span> You will destroy their descendants from the earth,  their posterity from among the children of men.  <span class="verse">11</span> For they intended evil against you.

He said to him,  “Follow me.”  He got up and followed him.   <span class="verse">10</span> As he sat in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.   <span class="verse">11</span> When the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”  <span class="verse">12</span> When Jesus heard it, he said to them,  “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.  <span class="verse">13</span> But you go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” <span class="verse">14</span> Then John’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don’t fast?”  <span class="verse">15</span> Jesus said to them,  “Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.  <span class="verse">16</span> No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.  <span class="verse">17</span> Neither do people put new wine into old wine skins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wine skins, and both are preserved.”

As it is also written in the second psalm,  ‘You are my Son.  Today I have become your father.’ <span class="verse">34</span> “Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken thus: ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.’ <span class="verse">35</span> Therefore he says also in another psalm, ‘You will not allow your Holy One to see decay.’ <span class="verse">36</span> For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, was laid with his fathers, and saw decay.   <span class="verse">37</span> But he whom God raised up saw no decay.   <span class="verse">38</span> Be it known to you therefore, brothers,  that through this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,   <span class="verse">39</span> and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.   <span class="verse">40</span> Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken in the prophets:  <span class="verse">41</span> ‘Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish;  for I work a work in your days,  a work which you will in no way believe, if one declares it to you.’ ”
