		<span class="reference">Genesis 10-11</span>  <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were born to them after the flood.  <span class="verse">2</span> The sons of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.   <span class="verse">3</span> The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.   <span class="verse">4</span> The sons of Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.   <span class="verse">5</span> Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their families, in their nations.  <span class="verse">6</span> The sons of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.   <span class="verse">7</span> The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.   <span class="verse">8</span> Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.   <span class="verse">9</span> He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh”.   <span class="verse">10</span> The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.   <span class="verse">11</span> Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,   <span class="verse">12</span> and Resen between Nineveh and the great city Calah.   <span class="verse">13</span> Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,   <span class="verse">14</span> Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and Caphtorim.  <span class="verse">15</span> Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,   <span class="verse">16</span> the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,   <span class="verse">17</span> the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,   <span class="verse">18</span> the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.   <span class="verse">19</span> The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon—as you go toward Gerar—to Gaza—as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha.   <span class="verse">20</span> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.  <span class="verse">21</span> Children were also born to Shem (the elder brother of Japheth), the father of all the children of Eber.   <span class="verse">22</span> The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.   <span class="verse">23</span> The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.   <span class="verse">24</span> Arpachshad became the father of Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber.   <span class="verse">25</span> To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan.   <span class="verse">26</span> Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,   <span class="verse">27</span> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,   <span class="verse">28</span> Obal, Abimael, Sheba,   <span class="verse">29</span> Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.   <span class="verse">30</span> Their dwelling extended from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.   <span class="verse">31</span> These are the sons of Shem, by their families, according to their languages, lands, and nations.  <span class="verse">32</span> These are the families of the sons of Noah, by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided from these in the earth after the flood.   <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.   <span class="verse">2</span> As they traveled from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.   <span class="verse">3</span> They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.   <span class="verse">4</span> They said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.   <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh said, “Behold, they are one people, and they all have one language, and this is what they begin to do. Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.   <span class="verse">7</span> Come, let’s go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.”   <span class="verse">8</span> So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They stopped building the city.   <span class="verse">9</span> Therefore its name was called Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of all the earth. From there, Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.  <span class="verse">10</span> This is the history of the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad two years after the flood.   <span class="verse">11</span> Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father of Arpachshad, and became the father of more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse">12</span> Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.   <span class="verse">13</span> Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Shelah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse">14</span> Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber.   <span class="verse">15</span> Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became the father of Eber, and became the father of more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse">16</span> Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.   <span class="verse">17</span> Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father of Peleg, and became the father of more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse">18</span> Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.   <span class="verse">19</span> Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father of Reu, and became the father of more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse">20</span> Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.   <span class="verse">21</span> Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father of Serug, and became the father of more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse">22</span> Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.   <span class="verse">23</span> Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor, and became the father of more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse">24</span> Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.   <span class="verse">25</span> Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father of Terah, and became the father of more sons and daughters.  <span class="verse">26</span> Terah lived seventy years, and became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.  <span class="verse">27</span> Now this is the history of the generations of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran became the father of Lot.   <span class="verse">28</span> Haran died in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldees, while his father Terah was still alive.   <span class="verse">29</span> Abram and Nahor married wives. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, who was also the father of Iscah.   <span class="verse">30</span> Sarai was barren. She had no child.   <span class="verse">31</span> Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife. They went from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan. They came to Haran and lived there.   <span class="verse">32</span> The days of Terah were two hundred five years. Terah died in Haran.

Consider my meditation.  <span class="verse">2</span> Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God;  for I pray to you.  <span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice.  In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.  <span class="verse">4</span> For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness.  Evil can’t live with you.  <span class="verse">5</span> The arrogant will not stand in your sight.  You hate all workers of iniquity.  <span class="verse">6</span> You will destroy those who speak lies.  Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.  <span class="verse">7</span> But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house.  I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.  <span class="verse">8</span> Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies.  Make your way straight before my face.  <span class="verse">9</span> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.  Their heart is destruction.  Their throat is an open tomb.  They flatter with their tongue.  <span class="verse">10</span> Hold them guilty, God.  Let them fall by their own counsels.  Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,  for they have rebelled against you.  <span class="verse">11</span> But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice.  Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them.  Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.  <span class="verse">12</span> For you will bless the righteous.  Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.

Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the region of Galilee,   <span class="verse">23</span> and came and lived in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets that he will be called a Nazarene.

		<span class="reference">Acts 3</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Peter and John were going up into the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. <span class="verse">2</span> A certain man who was lame from his mother’s womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask gifts for the needy of those who entered into the temple.   <span class="verse">3</span> Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive gifts for the needy.   <span class="verse">4</span> Peter, fastening his eyes on him, with John, said, “Look at us.”   <span class="verse">5</span> He listened to them, expecting to receive something from them.   <span class="verse">6</span> But Peter said, “I have no silver or gold, but what I have, that I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!”   <span class="verse">7</span> He took him by the right hand and raised him up. Immediately his feet and his ankle bones received strength.   <span class="verse">8</span> Leaping up, he stood and began to walk. He entered with them into the temple, walking, leaping, and praising God.   <span class="verse">9</span> All the people saw him walking and praising God.   <span class="verse">10</span> They recognized him, that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the needy at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. They were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.   <span class="verse">11</span> As the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.  <span class="verse">12</span> When Peter saw it, he responded to the people, “You men of Israel, why do you marvel at this man? Why do you fasten your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him walk?   <span class="verse">13</span> The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.   <span class="verse">14</span> But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,   <span class="verse">15</span> and killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, to which we are witnesses.   <span class="verse">16</span> By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.  <span class="verse">17</span> “Now, brothers,  I know that you did this in ignorance, as did also your rulers.   <span class="verse">18</span> But the things which God announced by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.  <span class="verse">19</span> “Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord,   <span class="verse">20</span> and that he may send Christ Jesus, who was ordained for you before,   <span class="verse">21</span> whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets.   <span class="verse">22</span> For Moses indeed said to the fathers, ‘The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers, like me. You shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you.   <span class="verse">23</span> It will be that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.’ <span class="verse">24</span> Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after, as many as have spoken, they also told of these days.   <span class="verse">25</span> You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘All the families of the earth will be blessed through your offspring.’ <span class="verse">26</span> God, having raised up his servant Jesus, sent him to you first to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your wickedness.”
