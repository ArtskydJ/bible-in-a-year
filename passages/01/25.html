		<span class="reference">Genesis 43</span>  <span class="chapter">43</span><span class="verse">1</span> The famine was severe in the land.   <span class="verse">2</span> When they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little more food.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’   <span class="verse">4</span> If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go down and buy you food;   <span class="verse">5</span> but if you don’t send him, we won’t go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.’ ”  <span class="verse">6</span> Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man that you had another brother?”  <span class="verse">7</span> They said, “The man asked directly concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down?’ ”  <span class="verse">8</span> Judah said to Israel, his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.   <span class="verse">9</span> I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever;   <span class="verse">10</span> for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would have returned a second time by now.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;   <span class="verse">12</span> and take double money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.   <span class="verse">13</span> Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.   <span class="verse">14</span> May God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.”  <span class="verse">15</span> The men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.   <span class="verse">16</span> When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me at noon.”  <span class="verse">17</span> The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.   <span class="verse">18</span> The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”   <span class="verse">19</span> They came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,   <span class="verse">20</span> and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food.   <span class="verse">21</span> When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.   <span class="verse">22</span> We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”  <span class="verse">23</span> He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them.   <span class="verse">24</span> The man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their donkeys fodder.   <span class="verse">25</span> They prepared the present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.  <span class="verse">26</span> When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to the earth before him.   <span class="verse">27</span> He asked them of their welfare, and said, “Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?”  <span class="verse">28</span> They said, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly.   <span class="verse">29</span> He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”   <span class="verse">30</span> Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his room, and wept there.   <span class="verse">31</span> He washed his face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”  <span class="verse">32</span> They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians don’t eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.   <span class="verse">33</span> They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled with one another.   <span class="verse">34</span> He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They drank, and were merry with him.

The expanse shows his handiwork.  <span class="verse">2</span> Day after day they pour out speech,  and night after night they display knowledge.  <span class="verse">3</span> There is no speech nor language,  where their voice is not heard.  <span class="verse">4</span> Their voice has gone out through all the earth,  their words to the end of the world.  In them he has set a tent for the sun,  <span class="verse">5</span> which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room,  like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.  <span class="verse">6</span> His going out is from the end of the heavens,  his circuit to its ends.  There is nothing hidden from its heat.  <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh’s law is perfect, restoring the soul.  Yahweh’s covenant is sure, making wise the simple.  <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh’s precepts are right, rejoicing the heart.  Yahweh’s commandment is pure, enlightening the eyes.  <span class="verse">9</span> The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.  Yahweh’s ordinances are true, and righteous altogether.  <span class="verse">10</span> They are more to be desired than gold, yes, than much fine gold,  sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.  <span class="verse">11</span> Moreover your servant is warned by them.  In keeping them there is great reward.  <span class="verse">12</span> Who can discern his errors?  Forgive me from hidden errors.  <span class="verse">13</span> Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.  Let them not have dominion over me.  Then I will be upright.  I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.  <span class="verse">14</span> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart  be acceptable in your sight,  Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.

We are dying!”  <span class="verse">26</span> He said to them,  “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?”   Then he got up, rebuked the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.  <span class="verse">27</span> The men marveled, saying, “What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”  <span class="verse">28</span> When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes,   two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way.   <span class="verse">29</span> Behold, they cried out, saying, “What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”   <span class="verse">30</span> Now there was a herd of many pigs feeding far away from them.   <span class="verse">31</span> The demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of pigs.”  <span class="verse">32</span> He said to them,  “Go!” They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water.   <span class="verse">33</span> Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons.   <span class="verse">34</span> Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.

		<span class="reference">Acts 13:1-12</span>  <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now in the assembly that was at Antioch there were some prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.   <span class="verse">2</span> As they served the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Separate Barnabas and Saul for me, for the work to which I have called them.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.   <span class="verse">4</span> So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.   <span class="verse">5</span> When they were at Salamis, they proclaimed God’s word in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as their attendant.   <span class="verse">6</span> When they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar Jesus,   <span class="verse">7</span> who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.   <span class="verse">8</span> But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.   <span class="verse">9</span> But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,   <span class="verse">10</span> and said, “You son of the devil, full of all deceit and all cunning, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?   <span class="verse">11</span> Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season!”  Immediately a mist and darkness fell on him. He went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.   <span class="verse">12</span> Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
