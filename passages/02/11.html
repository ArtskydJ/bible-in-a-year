Praise is fitting for the upright.  <span class="verse">2</span> Give thanks to Yahweh with the lyre.  Sing praises to him with the harp of ten strings.  <span class="verse">3</span> Sing to him a new song.  Play skillfully with a shout of joy!  <span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh’s word is right.  All his work is done in faithfulness.  <span class="verse">5</span> He loves righteousness and justice.  The earth is full of the loving kindness of Yahweh.  <span class="verse">6</span> By Yahweh’s word, the heavens were made:  all their army by the breath of his mouth.  <span class="verse">7</span> He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap.  He lays up the deeps in storehouses.  <span class="verse">8</span> Let all the earth fear Yahweh.  Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.  <span class="verse">9</span> For he spoke, and it was done.  He commanded, and it stood firm.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh brings the counsel of the nations to nothing.  He makes the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.  <span class="verse">11</span> The counsel of Yahweh stands fast forever,  the thoughts of his heart to all generations.  <span class="verse">12</span> Blessed is the nation whose God is Yahweh,  the people whom he has chosen for his own inheritance.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh looks from heaven.  He sees all the sons of men.  <span class="verse">14</span> From the place of his habitation he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth,  <span class="verse">15</span> he who fashions all of their hearts;  and he considers all of their works.  <span class="verse">16</span> There is no king saved by the multitude of an army.  A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.  <span class="verse">17</span> A horse is a vain thing for safety,  neither does he deliver any by his great power.  <span class="verse">18</span> Behold, Yahweh’s eye is on those who fear him,  on those who hope in his loving kindness,  <span class="verse">19</span> to deliver their soul from death,  to keep them alive in famine.  <span class="verse">20</span> Our soul has waited for Yahweh.  He is our help and our shield.  <span class="verse">21</span> For our heart rejoices in him,  because we have trusted in his holy name.  <span class="verse">22</span> Let your loving kindness be on us, Yahweh,  since we have hoped in you.

He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.”   <span class="verse">3</span> For Herod had arrested John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.   <span class="verse">4</span> For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”   <span class="verse">5</span> When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.   <span class="verse">6</span> But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod.   <span class="verse">7</span> Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.   <span class="verse">8</span> She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.”  <span class="verse">9</span> The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given,   <span class="verse">10</span> and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.   <span class="verse">11</span> His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother.   <span class="verse">12</span> His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.   <span class="verse">13</span> Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities.  <span class="verse">14</span> Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick.   <span class="verse">15</span> When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.”  <span class="verse">16</span> But Jesus said to them,  “They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.” <span class="verse">17</span> They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.”  <span class="verse">18</span> He said,  “Bring them here to me.” <span class="verse">19</span> He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes.   <span class="verse">20</span> They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces.   <span class="verse">21</span> Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.

The next day we touched at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium, and the day after we came to Miletus.   <span class="verse">16</span> For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.  <span class="verse">17</span> From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders of the assembly.   <span class="verse">18</span> When they had come to him, he said to them, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time,   <span class="verse">19</span> serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;   <span class="verse">20</span> how I didn’t shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,   <span class="verse">21</span> testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus. <span class="verse">22</span> Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there;   <span class="verse">23</span> except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.   <span class="verse">24</span> But these things don’t count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.  <span class="verse">25</span> “Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching God’s Kingdom, will see my face no more.   <span class="verse">26</span> Therefore I testify to you today that I am clean from the blood of all men,   <span class="verse">27</span> for I didn’t shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.   <span class="verse">28</span> Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and   God which he purchased with his own blood.
