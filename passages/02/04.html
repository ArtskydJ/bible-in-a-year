		<span class="reference">Exodus 9-10</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, that they may serve me.   <span class="verse">2</span> For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,   <span class="verse">3</span> behold, Yahweh’s hand is on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.   <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt; and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.” ’ ”   <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh appointed a set time, saying, “Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land.”   <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel, not one died.   <span class="verse">7</span> Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn’t let the people go.  <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, “Take handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.   <span class="verse">9</span> It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boils and blisters breaking out on man and on animal, throughout all the land of Egypt.”  <span class="verse">10</span> They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became boils and blisters breaking on man and on animal.   <span class="verse">11</span> The magicians couldn’t stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians.   <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, that they may serve me.   <span class="verse">14</span> For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and against your people; that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.   <span class="verse">15</span> For now I would have stretched out my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off from the earth;   <span class="verse">16</span> but indeed for this cause I have made you stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth,   <span class="verse">17</span> because you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won’t let them go.   <span class="verse">18</span> Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.   <span class="verse">19</span> Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter. The hail will come down on every man and animal that is found in the field, and isn’t brought home, and they will die.” ’ ”  <span class="verse">20</span> Those who feared Yahweh’s word among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.   <span class="verse">21</span> Whoever didn’t respect Yahweh’s word left his servants and his livestock in the field.  <span class="verse">22</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.”  <span class="verse">23</span> Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens, and Yahweh sent thunder and hail; and lightning flashed down to the earth. Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse">24</span> So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.   <span class="verse">25</span> The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.   <span class="verse">26</span> Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail.  <span class="verse">27</span> Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time. Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.   <span class="verse">28</span> Pray to Yahweh; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer.”  <span class="verse">29</span> Moses said to him, “As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh. The thunders shall cease, and there will not be any more hail; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh’s.   <span class="verse">30</span> But as for you and your servants, I know that you don’t yet fear Yahweh God.”  <span class="verse">31</span> The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley had ripened and the flax was blooming.   <span class="verse">32</span> But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had not grown up.   <span class="verse">33</span> Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to Yahweh; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.   <span class="verse">34</span> When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.   <span class="verse">35</span> The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn’t let the children of Israel go, just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.   <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs among them;   <span class="verse">2</span> and that you may tell in the hearing of your son, and of your son’s son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him, “This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me.   <span class="verse">4</span> Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,   <span class="verse">5</span> and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one won’t be able to see the earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.   <span class="verse">6</span> Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.’ ” He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.  <span class="verse">7</span> Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God. Don’t you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?”  <span class="verse">8</span> Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve Yahweh your God; but who are those who will go?”  <span class="verse">9</span> Moses said, “We will go with our young and with our old. We will go with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">10</span> He said to them, “Yahweh be with you if I let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your faces.   <span class="verse">11</span> Not so! Go now you who are men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you desire!” Then they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.”   <span class="verse">13</span> Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.   <span class="verse">14</span> The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, nor will there ever be again.   <span class="verse">15</span> For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse">16</span> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.   <span class="verse">17</span> Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh your God, that he may also take away from me this death.”  <span class="verse">18</span> Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh sent an exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea.  There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.   <span class="verse">20</span> But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he didn’t let the children of Israel go.  <span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.”   <span class="verse">22</span> Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.   <span class="verse">23</span> They didn’t see one another, and nobody rose from his place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.  <span class="verse">24</span> Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve Yahweh. Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with you.”  <span class="verse">25</span> Moses said, “You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.   <span class="verse">26</span> Our livestock also shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh our God; and we don’t know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we come there.”  <span class="verse">27</span> But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t let them go.   <span class="verse">28</span> Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!”  <span class="verse">29</span> Moses said, “You have spoken well. I will see your face again no more.”

Of whom shall I be afraid?  <span class="verse">2</span> When evildoers came at me to eat up my flesh,  even my adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell.  <span class="verse">3</span> Though an army should encamp against me,  my heart shall not fear.  Though war should rise against me,  even then I will be confident.  <span class="verse">4</span> One thing I have asked of Yahweh, that I will seek after:  that I may dwell in Yahweh’s house all the days of my life,  to see Yahweh’s beauty,  and to inquire in his temple.  <span class="verse">5</span> For in the day of trouble, he will keep me secretly in his pavilion.  In the secret place of his tabernacle, he will hide me.  He will lift me up on a rock.  <span class="verse">6</span> Now my head will be lifted up above my enemies around me.  I will offer sacrifices of joy in his tent.  I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to Yahweh.  <span class="verse">7</span> Hear, Yahweh, when I cry with my voice.  Have mercy also on me, and answer me.  <span class="verse">8</span> When you said, “Seek my face,”  my heart said to you, “I will seek your face, Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Don’t hide your face from me.  Don’t put your servant away in anger.  You have been my help.  Don’t abandon me,  neither forsake me, God of my salvation.  <span class="verse">10</span> When my father and my mother forsake me,  then Yahweh will take me up.  <span class="verse">11</span> Teach me your way, Yahweh.  Lead me in a straight path, because of my enemies.  <span class="verse">12</span> Don’t deliver me over to the desire of my adversaries,  for false witnesses have risen up against me,  such as breathe out cruelty.  <span class="verse">13</span> I am still confident of this:  I will see the goodness of Yahweh in the land of the living.  <span class="verse">14</span> Wait for Yahweh.  Be strong, and let your heart take courage.  Yes, wait for Yahweh.

		<span class="reference">Matthew 12:1-21</span>  <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields. His disciples were hungry and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.   <span class="verse">2</span> But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said to him, “Behold, your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.”  <span class="verse">3</span> But he said to them,  “Haven’t you read what David did, when he was hungry, and those who were with him;  <span class="verse">4</span> how he entered into God’s house, and ate the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests? <span class="verse">5</span> Or have you not read in the law, that on the Sabbath day, the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are guiltless?  <span class="verse">6</span> But I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.  <span class="verse">7</span> But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you wouldn’t have condemned the guiltless.  <span class="verse">8</span> For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.” <span class="verse">9</span> He departed from there, and went into their synagogue.   <span class="verse">10</span> And behold there was a man with a withered hand. They asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?” that they might accuse him.  <span class="verse">11</span> He said to them,  “What man is there among you, who has one sheep, and if this one falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, won’t he grab on to it, and lift it out?  <span class="verse">12</span> Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.” <span class="verse">13</span> Then he told the man,  “Stretch out your hand.”  He stretched it out; and it was restored whole, just like the other.   <span class="verse">14</span> But the Pharisees went out, and conspired against him, how they might destroy him.   <span class="verse">15</span> Jesus, perceiving that, withdrew from there. Great multitudes followed him; and he healed them all,   <span class="verse">16</span> and commanded them that they should not make him known:   <span class="verse">17</span> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,  <span class="verse">18</span> “Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;  my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:  I will put my Spirit on him.  He will proclaim justice to the nations.  <span class="verse">19</span> He will not strive, nor shout;  neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.  <span class="verse">20</span> He won’t break a bruised reed.  He won’t quench a smoking flax,  until he leads justice to victory.  <span class="verse">21</span> In his name, the nations will hope.”

		<span class="reference">Acts 17:1-15</span>  <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.   <span class="verse">2</span> Paul, as was his custom, went in to them, and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,   <span class="verse">3</span> explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.   <span class="verse">5</span> But the unpersuaded Jews took along  some wicked men from the marketplace, and gathering a crowd, set the city in an uproar. Assaulting the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the people.   <span class="verse">6</span> When they didn’t find them, they dragged Jason and certain brothers   before the rulers of the city, crying, “These who have turned the world upside down have come here also,   <span class="verse">7</span> whom Jason has received. These all act contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus!”   <span class="verse">8</span> The multitude and the rulers of the city were troubled when they heard these things.   <span class="verse">9</span> When they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.   <span class="verse">10</span> The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.  <span class="verse">11</span> Now these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.   <span class="verse">12</span> Many of them therefore believed; also of the prominent Greek women, and not a few men.   <span class="verse">13</span> But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Beroea also, they came there likewise, agitating the multitudes.   <span class="verse">14</span> Then the brothers immediately sent out Paul to go as far as to the sea, and Silas and Timothy still stayed there.   <span class="verse">15</span> But those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens. Receiving a commandment to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly, they departed.
