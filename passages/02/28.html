		<span class="reference">Leviticus 26-27</span>  <span class="chapter">26</span><span class="verse">1</span> “ ‘You shall make for yourselves no idols, and you shall not raise up a carved image or a pillar, and you shall not place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it; for I am Yahweh your God.  <span class="verse">2</span> “ ‘You shall keep my Sabbaths, and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am Yahweh.  <span class="verse">3</span> “ ‘If you walk in my statutes and keep my commandments, and do them,   <span class="verse">4</span> then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.   <span class="verse">5</span> Your threshing shall continue until the vintage, and the vintage shall continue until the sowing time. You shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.  <span class="verse">6</span> “ ‘I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one will make you afraid. I will remove evil animals out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.   <span class="verse">7</span> You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.   <span class="verse">8</span> Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.  <span class="verse">9</span> “ ‘I will have respect for you, make you fruitful, multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.   <span class="verse">10</span> You shall eat old supplies long kept, and you shall move out the old because of the new.   <span class="verse">11</span> I will set my tent among you, and my soul won’t abhor you.   <span class="verse">12</span> I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people.   <span class="verse">13</span> I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves. I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you walk upright.  <span class="verse">14</span> “ ‘But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments,   <span class="verse">15</span> and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant,   <span class="verse">16</span> I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away. You will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it.   <span class="verse">17</span> I will set my face against you, and you will be struck before your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you; and you will flee when no one pursues you.  <span class="verse">18</span> “ ‘If you in spite of these things will not listen to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.   <span class="verse">19</span> I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky like iron, and your soil like bronze.   <span class="verse">20</span> Your strength will be spent in vain; for your land won’t yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit.  <span class="verse">21</span> “ ‘If you walk contrary to me, and won’t listen to me, then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.   <span class="verse">22</span> I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few in number. Your roads will become desolate.  <span class="verse">23</span> “ ‘If by these things you won’t be turned back to me, but will walk contrary to me,   <span class="verse">24</span> then I will also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.   <span class="verse">25</span> I will bring a sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant. You will be gathered together within your cities, and I will send the pestilence among you. You will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.   <span class="verse">26</span> When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight. You shall eat, and not be satisfied.  <span class="verse">27</span> “ ‘If you in spite of this won’t listen to me, but walk contrary to me,   <span class="verse">28</span> then I will walk contrary to you in wrath. I will also chastise you seven times for your sins.   <span class="verse">29</span> You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.   <span class="verse">30</span> I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you.   <span class="verse">31</span> I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation. I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings.   <span class="verse">32</span> I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies that dwell in it will be astonished at it.   <span class="verse">33</span> I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you. Your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.   <span class="verse">34</span> Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies’ land. Even then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.   <span class="verse">35</span> As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn’t have in your Sabbaths when you lived on it.  <span class="verse">36</span> “ ‘As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. The sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword. They will fall when no one pursues.   <span class="verse">37</span> They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues. You will have no power to stand before your enemies.   <span class="verse">38</span> You will perish among the nations. The land of your enemies will eat you up.   <span class="verse">39</span> Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away with them.  <span class="verse">40</span> “ ‘If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me; and also that because they walked contrary to me,   <span class="verse">41</span> I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity,   <span class="verse">42</span> then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham; and I will remember the land.   <span class="verse">43</span> The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.   <span class="verse">44</span> Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God.   <span class="verse">45</span> But I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.’ ”  <span class="verse">46</span> These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.   <span class="chapter">27</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘When a man consecrates a person to Yahweh in a vow, according to your valuation,   <span class="verse">3</span> your valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel  of the sanctuary.   <span class="verse">4</span> If she is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.   <span class="verse">5</span> If the person is from five years old to twenty years old, then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels.   <span class="verse">6</span> If the person is from a month old to five years old, then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.   <span class="verse">7</span> If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if he is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels.   <span class="verse">8</span> But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall assign a value to him. The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.  <span class="verse">9</span> “ ‘If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy.   <span class="verse">10</span> He shall not alter it, nor exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good. If he shall at all exchange animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.   <span class="verse">11</span> If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before the priest;   <span class="verse">12</span> and the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest evaluates it, so it shall be.   <span class="verse">13</span> But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.  <span class="verse">14</span> “ ‘When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad. As the priest evaluates it, so it shall stand.   <span class="verse">15</span> If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall be his.  <span class="verse">16</span> “ ‘If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it. The sowing of a homer   of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels  of silver.   <span class="verse">17</span> If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.   <span class="verse">18</span> But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made from your valuation.   <span class="verse">19</span> If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall remain his.   <span class="verse">20</span> If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;   <span class="verse">21</span> but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy to Yahweh, as a devoted field. It shall be owned by the priests.  <span class="verse">22</span> “ ‘If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession,   <span class="verse">23</span> then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">24</span> In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.   <span class="verse">25</span> All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs  to the shekel. <span class="verse">26</span> “ ‘However the firstborn among animals, which belongs to Yahweh as a firstborn, no man may dedicate, whether an ox or a sheep. It is Yahweh’s.   <span class="verse">27</span> If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it; or if it isn’t redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.  <span class="verse">28</span> “ ‘Notwithstanding, no devoted thing that a man devotes to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed. Everything that is permanently devoted is most holy to Yahweh.  <span class="verse">29</span> “ ‘No one devoted to destruction, who shall be devoted from among men, shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death.  <span class="verse">30</span> “ ‘All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is Yahweh’s. It is holy to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">31</span> If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth part to it.   <span class="verse">32</span> All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">33</span> He shall not examine whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange it. If he exchanges it at all, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.’ ”  <span class="verse">34</span> These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.

Untie them, and bring them to me.  <span class="verse">3</span> If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and immediately he will send them.” <span class="verse">4</span> All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,  <span class="verse">5</span> “Tell the daughter of Zion,  behold, your King comes to you,  humble, and riding on a donkey,  on a colt, the foal of a donkey.” <span class="verse">6</span> The disciples went, and did just as Jesus commanded them,   <span class="verse">7</span> and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their clothes on them; and he sat on them.   <span class="verse">8</span> A very great multitude spread their clothes on the road. Others cut branches from the trees, and spread them on the road.   <span class="verse">9</span> The multitudes who went in front of him, and those who followed, kept shouting, “Hosanna   to the son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”  <span class="verse">10</span> When he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”   <span class="verse">11</span> The multitudes said, “This is the prophet, Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.”

		<span class="reference">Acts 28:17-31</span>  <span class="chapter">28</span><span class="verse">17</span> After three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, “I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,   <span class="verse">18</span> who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.   <span class="verse">19</span> But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.   <span class="verse">20</span> For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.”  <span class="verse">21</span> They said to him, “We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.   <span class="verse">22</span> But we desire to hear from you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.”  <span class="verse">23</span> When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him at his lodging. He explained to them, testifying about God’s Kingdom, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.   <span class="verse">24</span> Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.   <span class="verse">25</span> When they didn’t agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,   <span class="verse">26</span> saying,  ‘Go to this people and say,  in hearing, you will hear,  but will in no way understand.  In seeing, you will see,  but will in no way perceive.  <span class="verse">27</span> For this people’s heart has grown callous.  Their ears are dull of hearing.  Their eyes they have closed.  Lest they should see with their eyes,  hear with their ears,  understand with their heart,  and would turn again,  then I would heal them.’ <span class="verse">28</span> “Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the nations, and they will listen.”  <span class="verse">29</span> When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves. <span class="verse">30</span> Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house and received all who were coming to him,   <span class="verse">31</span> preaching God’s Kingdom, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.
