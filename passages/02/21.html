You shall not touch their carcasses. They are unclean to you.  <span class="verse">9</span> “ ‘These you may eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, that you may eat.   <span class="verse">10</span> All that don’t have fins and scales in the seas and rivers, all that move in the waters, and all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are an abomination to you,   <span class="verse">11</span> and you shall detest them. You shall not eat of their meat, and you shall detest their carcasses.   <span class="verse">12</span> Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters is an abomination to you.  <span class="verse">13</span> “ ‘You shall detest these among the birds; they shall not be eaten because they are an abomination: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,   <span class="verse">14</span> the red kite, any kind of black kite,   <span class="verse">15</span> any kind of raven,   <span class="verse">16</span> the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,   <span class="verse">17</span> the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,   <span class="verse">18</span> the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,   <span class="verse">19</span> the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.  <span class="verse">20</span> “ ‘All flying insects that walk on all fours are an abomination to you.   <span class="verse">21</span> Yet you may eat these: of all winged creeping things that go on all fours, which have long, jointed legs for hopping on the earth.   <span class="verse">22</span> Even of these you may eat: any kind of locust, any kind of katydid, any kind of cricket, and any kind of grasshopper.   <span class="verse">23</span> But all winged creeping things which have four feet are an abomination to you.  <span class="verse">24</span> “ ‘By these you will become unclean: whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.   <span class="verse">25</span> Whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.  <span class="verse">26</span> “ ‘Every animal which has a split hoof that isn’t completely divided, or doesn’t chew the cud, is unclean to you. Everyone who touches them shall be unclean.   <span class="verse">27</span> Whatever goes on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours, they are unclean to you. Whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.   <span class="verse">28</span> He who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. They are unclean to you.  <span class="verse">29</span> “ ‘These are they which are unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the weasel, the rat, any kind of great lizard,   <span class="verse">30</span> the gecko, and the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink, and the chameleon.   <span class="verse">31</span> These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep. Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until the evening.   <span class="verse">32</span> Anything they fall on when they are dead shall be unclean; whether it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack, whatever vessel it is, with which any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening. Then it will be clean.   <span class="verse">33</span> Every earthen vessel into which any of them falls and all that is in it shall be unclean. You shall break it.   <span class="verse">34</span> All food which may be eaten which is soaked in water shall be unclean. All drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean.   <span class="verse">35</span> Everything whereupon part of their carcass falls shall be unclean; whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces. They are unclean, and shall be unclean to you.   <span class="verse">36</span> Nevertheless a spring or a cistern in which water is gathered shall be clean, but that which touches their carcass shall be unclean.   <span class="verse">37</span> If part of their carcass falls on any sowing seed which is to be sown, it is clean.   <span class="verse">38</span> But if water is put on the seed, and part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.  <span class="verse">39</span> “ ‘If any animal of which you may eat dies, he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.   <span class="verse">40</span> He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. He also who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.  <span class="verse">41</span> “ ‘Every creeping thing that creeps on the earth is an abomination. It shall not be eaten.   <span class="verse">42</span> Whatever goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all creeping things that creep on the earth, them you shall not eat; for they are an abomination.   <span class="verse">43</span> You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creeps. You shall not make yourselves unclean with them, that you should be defiled by them.   <span class="verse">44</span> For I am Yahweh your God. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am holy. You shall not defile yourselves with any kind of creeping thing that moves on the earth.   <span class="verse">45</span> For I am Yahweh who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.  <span class="verse">46</span> “ ‘This is the law of the animal, and of the bird, and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that creeps on the earth,   <span class="verse">47</span> to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean, and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten.’ ”   <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean.   <span class="verse">3</span> In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.   <span class="verse">4</span> She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.   <span class="verse">5</span> But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days.  <span class="verse">6</span> “ ‘When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove, for a sin offering.   <span class="verse">7</span> He shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; then she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.  “ ‘This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.   <span class="verse">8</span> If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering. The priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’ ”   <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “When a man shall have a swelling in his body’s skin, or a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his body the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons, the priests.   <span class="verse">3</span> The priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body. If the hair in the plague has turned white, and the appearance of the plague is deeper than the body’s skin, it is the plague of leprosy; so the priest shall examine him and pronounce him unclean.   <span class="verse">4</span> If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body, and its appearance isn’t deeper than the skin, and its hair hasn’t turned white, then the priest shall isolate the infected person for seven days.   <span class="verse">5</span> The priest shall examine him on the seventh day. Behold, if in his eyes the plague is arrested and the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days.   <span class="verse">6</span> The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day. Behold, if the plague has faded and the plague hasn’t spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. It is a scab. He shall wash his clothes, and be clean.   <span class="verse">7</span> But if the scab spreads on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again.   <span class="verse">8</span> The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is leprosy.  <span class="verse">9</span> “When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest;   <span class="verse">10</span> and the priest shall examine him. Behold, if there is a white swelling in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,   <span class="verse">11</span> it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. He shall not isolate him, for he is already unclean.  <span class="verse">12</span> “If the leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of the infected person from his head even to his feet, as far as it appears to the priest,   <span class="verse">13</span> then the priest shall examine him. Behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the plague. It has all turned white: he is clean.   <span class="verse">14</span> But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.   <span class="verse">15</span> The priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean. It is leprosy.   <span class="verse">16</span> Or if the raw flesh turns again, and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest.   <span class="verse">17</span> The priest shall examine him. Behold, if the plague has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean of the plague. He is clean.  <span class="verse">18</span> “When the body has a boil on its skin, and it has healed,   <span class="verse">19</span> and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shown to the priest.   <span class="verse">20</span> The priest shall examine it. Behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and its hair has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy. It has broken out in the boil.   <span class="verse">21</span> But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white hairs in it, and it isn’t deeper than the skin, but is dim, then the priest shall isolate him seven days.   <span class="verse">22</span> If it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is a plague.   <span class="verse">23</span> But if the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn’t spread, it is the scar from the boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.  <span class="verse">24</span> “Or when the body has a burn from fire on its skin, and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white,   <span class="verse">25</span> then the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and its appearance is deeper than the skin, it is leprosy. It has broken out in the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy.   <span class="verse">26</span> But if the priest examines it, and behold, there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it isn’t deeper than the skin, but has faded, then the priest shall isolate him seven days.   <span class="verse">27</span> The priest shall examine him on the seventh day. If it has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is the plague of leprosy.   <span class="verse">28</span> If the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn’t spread in the skin, but is faded, it is the swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the scar from the burn.  <span class="verse">29</span> “When a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard,   <span class="verse">30</span> then the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and the hair in it is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean. It is an itch. It is leprosy of the head or of the beard.   <span class="verse">31</span> If the priest examines the plague of itching, and behold, its appearance isn’t deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate the person infected with itching seven days.   <span class="verse">32</span> On the seventh day the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if the itch hasn’t spread, and there is no yellow hair in it, and the appearance of the itch isn’t deeper than the skin,   <span class="verse">33</span> then he shall be shaved, but he shall not shave the itch. Then the priest shall isolate the one who has the itch seven more days.   <span class="verse">34</span> On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the itch; and behold, if the itch hasn’t spread in the skin, and its appearance isn’t deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean. He shall wash his clothes and be clean.   <span class="verse">35</span> But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing,   <span class="verse">36</span> then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the itch has spread in the skin, the priest shall not look for the yellow hair; he is unclean.   <span class="verse">37</span> But if in his eyes the itch is arrested and black hair has grown in it, then the itch is healed. He is clean. The priest shall pronounce him clean.  <span class="verse">38</span> “When a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the body, even white bright spots,   <span class="verse">39</span> then the priest shall examine them. Behold, if the bright spots on the skin of their body are a dull white, it is a harmless rash. It has broken out in the skin. He is clean.  <span class="verse">40</span> “If a man’s hair has fallen from his head, he is bald. He is clean.   <span class="verse">41</span> If his hair has fallen off from the front part of his head, he is forehead bald. He is clean.   <span class="verse">42</span> But if a reddish-white plague is in the bald head or the bald forehead, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head or his bald forehead.   <span class="verse">43</span> Then the priest shall examine him. Behold, if the swelling of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body,   <span class="verse">44</span> he is a leprous man. He is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean. His plague is on his head.  <span class="verse">45</span> “The leper in whom the plague is shall wear torn clothes, and the hair of his head shall hang loose. He shall cover his upper lip, and shall cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’   <span class="verse">46</span> All the days in which the plague is in him he shall be unclean. He is unclean. He shall dwell alone. His dwelling shall be outside of the camp.  <span class="verse">47</span> “The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it is a woolen garment, or a linen garment;   <span class="verse">48</span> whether it is in warp or woof;  of linen or of wool; whether in a leather, or in anything made of leather;   <span class="verse">49</span> if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the leather, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything made of leather; it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shown to the priest.   <span class="verse">50</span> The priest shall examine the plague, and isolate the plague seven days.   <span class="verse">51</span> He shall examine the plague on the seventh day. If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever use the skin is used for, the plague is a destructive mildew. It is unclean.   <span class="verse">52</span> He shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of leather, in which the plague is, for it is a destructive mildew. It shall be burned in the fire.  <span class="verse">53</span> “If the priest examines it, and behold, the plague hasn’t spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;   <span class="verse">54</span> then the priest shall command that they wash the thing that the plague is in, and he shall isolate it seven more days.   <span class="verse">55</span> Then the priest shall examine it, after the plague is washed; and behold, if the plague hasn’t changed its color, and the plague hasn’t spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire. It is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness is inside or outside.   <span class="verse">56</span> If the priest looks, and behold, the plague has faded after it is washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof;   <span class="verse">57</span> and if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading. You shall burn with fire that in which the plague is.   <span class="verse">58</span> The garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, which you shall wash, if the plague has departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and it will be clean.”  <span class="verse">59</span> This is the law of the plague of mildew in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or in anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

		<span class="reference">Acts 25:13-27</span>  <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">13</span> Now when some days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.   <span class="verse">14</span> As he stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, “There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;   <span class="verse">15</span> about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him.   <span class="verse">16</span> I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man to destruction before the accused has met the accusers face to face and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.   <span class="verse">17</span> When therefore they had come together here, I didn’t delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought.   <span class="verse">18</span> When the accusers stood up, they brought no charges against him of such things as I supposed;   <span class="verse">19</span> but had certain questions against him about their own religion, and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.   <span class="verse">20</span> Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.   <span class="verse">21</span> But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send him to Caesar.”  <span class="verse">22</span> Agrippa said to Festus, “I also would like to hear the man myself.”  “Tomorrow,” he said, “you shall hear him.”  <span class="verse">23</span> So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the commanding officers and the principal men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.   <span class="verse">24</span> Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.   <span class="verse">25</span> But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him,   <span class="verse">26</span> of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have something to write.   <span class="verse">27</span> For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to also specify the charges against him.”
