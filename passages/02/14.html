		<span class="reference">Exodus 32-33</span>  <span class="chapter">32</span><span class="verse">1</span> When the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.”  <span class="verse">2</span> Aaron said to them, “Take off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.”  <span class="verse">3</span> All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.   <span class="verse">4</span> He received what they handed him, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a molded calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.”  <span class="verse">5</span> When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">6</span> They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.  <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, get down; for your people, who you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!   <span class="verse">8</span> They have turned away quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molded calf, and have worshiped it, and have sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.’ ”  <span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people.   <span class="verse">10</span> Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?   <span class="verse">12</span> Why should the Egyptians talk, saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your fierce wrath, and turn away from this evil against your people.   <span class="verse">13</span> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your offspring  as the stars of the sky, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they shall inherit it forever.’ ”  <span class="verse">14</span> So Yahweh turned away from the evil which he said he would do to his people.  <span class="verse">15</span> Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand; tablets that were written on both their sides. They were written on one side and on the other.   <span class="verse">16</span> The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.  <span class="verse">17</span> When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in the camp.”  <span class="verse">18</span> He said, “It isn’t the voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I hear.”   <span class="verse">19</span> As soon as he came near to the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses’ anger grew hot, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mountain.   <span class="verse">20</span> He took the calf which they had made, and burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink it.  <span class="verse">21</span> Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?”  <span class="verse">22</span> Aaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil.   <span class="verse">23</span> For they said to me, ‘Make us gods, which shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.’   <span class="verse">24</span> I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let them take it off.’ So they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”  <span class="verse">25</span> When Moses saw that the people were out of control, (for Aaron had let them lose control, causing derision among their enemies),   <span class="verse">26</span> then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on Yahweh’s side, come to me!”  All the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.   <span class="verse">27</span> He said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’ ”   <span class="verse">28</span> The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. About three thousand men fell of the people that day.   <span class="verse">29</span> Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, for every man was against his son and against his brother, that he may give you a blessing today.”  <span class="verse">30</span> On the next day, Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.”  <span class="verse">31</span> Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.   <span class="verse">32</span> Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have written.”  <span class="verse">33</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot him out of my book.   <span class="verse">34</span> Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.”   <span class="verse">35</span> Yahweh struck the people, because of what they did with the calf, which Aaron made.   <span class="chapter">33</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Depart, go up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’   <span class="verse">2</span> I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.   <span class="verse">3</span> Go to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest I consume you on the way.”  <span class="verse">4</span> When the people heard this evil news, they mourned; and no one put on his jewelry.  <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh had said to Moses, “Tell the children of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go up among you for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.’ ”  <span class="verse">6</span> The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.  <span class="verse">7</span> Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it “The Tent of Meeting.” Everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of Meeting, which was outside the camp.   <span class="verse">8</span> When Moses went out to the Tent, all the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.   <span class="verse">9</span> When Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and Yahweh spoke with Moses.   <span class="verse">10</span> All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door.   <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn’t depart from the Tent.  <span class="verse">12</span> Moses said to Yahweh, “Behold, you tell me, ‘Bring up this people;’ and you haven’t let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’   <span class="verse">13</span> Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me your way, now, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight; and consider that this nation is your people.”  <span class="verse">14</span> He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Moses said to him, “If your presence doesn’t go with me, don’t carry us up from here.   <span class="verse">16</span> For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn’t it that you go with us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who are on the surface of the earth?”  <span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “I will do this thing also that you have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.”  <span class="verse">18</span> Moses said, “Please show me your glory.”  <span class="verse">19</span> He said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim Yahweh’s name before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.”   <span class="verse">20</span> He said, “You cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live.”   <span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh also said, “Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on the rock.   <span class="verse">22</span> It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;   <span class="verse">23</span> then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back; but my face shall not be seen.”

The attackers gathered themselves together against me, and I didn’t know it.  They tore at me, and didn’t cease.  <span class="verse">16</span> Like the profane mockers in feasts,  they gnashed their teeth at me.  <span class="verse">17</span> Lord, how long will you look on?  Rescue my soul from their destruction,  my precious life from the lions.  <span class="verse">18</span> I will give you thanks in the great assembly.  I will praise you among many people.  <span class="verse">19</span> Don’t let those who are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;  neither let those who hate me without a cause wink their eyes.  <span class="verse">20</span> For they don’t speak peace,  but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.  <span class="verse">21</span> Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.  They said, “Aha! Aha! Our eye has seen it!”  <span class="verse">22</span> You have seen it, Yahweh. Don’t keep silent.  Lord, don’t be far from me.  <span class="verse">23</span> Wake up! Rise up to defend me, my God!  My Lord, contend for me!  <span class="verse">24</span> Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness.  Don’t let them gloat over me.  <span class="verse">25</span> Don’t let them say in their heart, “Aha! That’s the way we want it!”  Don’t let them say, “We have swallowed him up!”  <span class="verse">26</span> Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice at my calamity.  Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor who magnify themselves against me.  <span class="verse">27</span> Let those who favor my righteous cause shout for joy and be glad.  Yes, let them say continually, “May Yahweh be magnified,  who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!”  <span class="verse">28</span> My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long.

My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”  <span class="verse">23</span> But he answered her not a word.  His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”  <span class="verse">24</span> But he answered,  “I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” <span class="verse">25</span> But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”  <span class="verse">26</span> But he answered,  “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” <span class="verse">27</span> But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”  <span class="verse">28</span> Then Jesus answered her,  “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”  And her daughter was healed from that hour.

		<span class="reference">Acts 21:27-40</span>  <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">27</span> When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,   <span class="verse">28</span> crying out, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!”   <span class="verse">29</span> For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.  <span class="verse">30</span> All the city was moved and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple. Immediately the doors were shut.   <span class="verse">31</span> As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.   <span class="verse">32</span> Immediately he took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.   <span class="verse">33</span> Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him, commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what he had done.   <span class="verse">34</span> Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd. When he couldn’t find out the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.  <span class="verse">35</span> When he came to the stairs, he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;   <span class="verse">36</span> for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, “Away with him!”   <span class="verse">37</span> As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commanding officer, “May I speak to you?”  He said, “Do you know Greek?   <span class="verse">38</span> Aren’t you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?”  <span class="verse">39</span> But Paul said, “I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, allow me to speak to the people.”  <span class="verse">40</span> When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
