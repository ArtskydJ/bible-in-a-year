		<span class="reference">Exodus 34</span>  <span class="chapter">34</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Chisel two stone tablets like the first. I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.   <span class="verse">2</span> Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.   <span class="verse">3</span> No one shall come up with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain. Do not let the flocks or herds graze in front of that mountain.”  <span class="verse">4</span> He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; then Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.   <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed Yahweh’s name.   <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, “Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,   <span class="verse">7</span> keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children’s children, on the third and on the fourth generation.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.   <span class="verse">9</span> He said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go among us, even though this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”  <span class="verse">10</span> He said, “Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.   <span class="verse">11</span> Observe that which I command you today. Behold, I will drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.   <span class="verse">12</span> Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare among you;   <span class="verse">13</span> but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherah poles;   <span class="verse">14</span> for you shall worship no other god; for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.  <span class="verse">15</span> “Don’t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;   <span class="verse">16</span> and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods.  <span class="verse">17</span> “You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.  <span class="verse">18</span> “You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt.  <span class="verse">19</span> “All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.   <span class="verse">20</span> You shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb. If you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. No one shall appear before me empty.  <span class="verse">21</span> “Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.  <span class="verse">22</span> “You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year’s end.   <span class="verse">23</span> Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel.   <span class="verse">24</span> For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.  <span class="verse">25</span> “You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread. The sacrifice of the feast of the Passover shall not be left to the morning.  <span class="verse">26</span> “You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God.  “You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.”  <span class="verse">27</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Write these words; for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”  <span class="verse">28</span> He was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.  <span class="verse">29</span> When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mountain, Moses didn’t know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.   <span class="verse">30</span> When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.   <span class="verse">31</span> Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.   <span class="verse">32</span> Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.   <span class="verse">33</span> When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.   <span class="verse">34</span> But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.   <span class="verse">35</span> The children of Israel saw Moses’ face, that the skin of Moses’ face shone; so Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

He has ceased to be wise and to do good.  <span class="verse">4</span> He plots iniquity on his bed.  He sets himself in a way that is not good.  He doesn’t abhor evil.  <span class="verse">5</span> Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens.  Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.  <span class="verse">6</span> Your righteousness is like the mountains of God.  Your judgments are like a great deep.  Yahweh, you preserve man and animal.  <span class="verse">7</span> How precious is your loving kindness, God!  The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.  <span class="verse">8</span> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house.  You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.  <span class="verse">9</span> For with you is the spring of life.  In your light we will see light.  <span class="verse">10</span> Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,  your righteousness to the upright in heart.  <span class="verse">11</span> Don’t let the foot of pride come against me.  Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive me away.  <span class="verse">12</span> There the workers of iniquity are fallen.  They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.

He healed them,   <span class="verse">31</span> so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.  <span class="verse">32</span> Jesus summoned his disciples and said,  “I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.”  <span class="verse">33</span> The disciples said to him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”  <span class="verse">34</span> Jesus said to them,  “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”  <span class="verse">35</span> He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;   <span class="verse">36</span> and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.   <span class="verse">37</span> They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.   <span class="verse">38</span> Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.   <span class="verse">39</span> Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.

He said,   <span class="verse">3</span> “I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, instructed according to the strict tradition of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God, even as you all are today.   <span class="verse">4</span> I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.   <span class="verse">5</span> As also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify, from whom also I received letters to the brothers, and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished.   <span class="verse">6</span> As I made my journey, and came close to Damascus, about noon, suddenly a great light shone around me from the sky.   <span class="verse">7</span> I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me,  ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’ <span class="verse">8</span> I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ He said to me,  ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.’ <span class="verse">9</span> “Those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they didn’t understand the voice of him who spoke to me.   <span class="verse">10</span> I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me,  ‘Arise, and go into Damascus. There you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do.’ <span class="verse">11</span> When I couldn’t see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.   <span class="verse">12</span> One Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus,   <span class="verse">13</span> came to me, and standing by me said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ In that very hour I looked up at him.   <span class="verse">14</span> He said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.   <span class="verse">15</span> For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.   <span class="verse">16</span> Now why do you wait? Arise, be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.’  <span class="verse">17</span> “When I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,   <span class="verse">18</span> and saw him saying to me,  ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not receive testimony concerning me from you.’ <span class="verse">19</span> I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you.   <span class="verse">20</span> When the blood of Stephen, your witness, was shed, I also was standing by, consenting to his death, and guarding the cloaks of those who killed him.’  <span class="verse">21</span> “He said to me,  ‘Depart, for I will send you out far from here to the Gentiles.’ ”
