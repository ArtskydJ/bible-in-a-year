		<span class="reference">Leviticus 20-21</span>  <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Moreover, you shall tell the children of Israel, ‘Anyone of the children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as foreigners in Israel, who gives any of his offspring  to Molech shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone that person with stones.   <span class="verse">3</span> I also will set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given of his offspring to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.   <span class="verse">4</span> If the people of the land all hide their eyes from that person when he gives of his offspring to Molech, and don’t put him to death,   <span class="verse">5</span> then I will set my face against that man and against his family, and will cut him off, and all who play the prostitute after him to play the prostitute with Molech, from among their people.  <span class="verse">6</span> “ ‘The person that turns to those who are mediums and wizards, to play the prostitute after them, I will even set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people.  <span class="verse">7</span> “ ‘Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am Yahweh your God.   <span class="verse">8</span> You shall keep my statutes, and do them. I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.  <span class="verse">9</span> “ ‘For everyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon himself.  <span class="verse">10</span> “ ‘The man who commits adultery with another man’s wife, even he who commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.  <span class="verse">11</span> “ ‘The man who lies with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness. Both of them shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon themselves.  <span class="verse">12</span> “ ‘If a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death. They have committed a perversion. Their blood shall be upon themselves.  <span class="verse">13</span> “ ‘If a man lies with a male, as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon themselves.  <span class="verse">14</span> “ ‘If a man takes a wife and her mother, it is wickedness. They shall be burned with fire, both he and they, that there may be no wickedness among you.  <span class="verse">15</span> “ ‘If a man lies with an animal, he shall surely be put to death; and you shall kill the animal.  <span class="verse">16</span> “ ‘If a woman approaches any animal and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them.  <span class="verse">17</span> “ ‘If a man takes his sister—his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter—and sees her nakedness, and she sees his nakedness, it is a shameful thing. They shall be cut off in the sight of the children of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness. He shall bear his iniquity.  <span class="verse">18</span> “ ‘If a man lies with a woman having her monthly period, and uncovers her nakedness, he has made her fountain naked, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood. Both of them shall be cut off from among their people.  <span class="verse">19</span> “ ‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, nor of your father’s sister, for he has made his close relative naked. They shall bear their iniquity.   <span class="verse">20</span> If a man lies with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness. They shall bear their sin. They shall die childless.  <span class="verse">21</span> “ ‘If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is an impurity. He has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They shall be childless.  <span class="verse">22</span> “ ‘You shall therefore keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and do them, that the land where I am bringing you to dwell may not vomit you out.   <span class="verse">23</span> You shall not walk in the customs of the nation which I am casting out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.   <span class="verse">24</span> But I have said to you, “You shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.” I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples.  <span class="verse">25</span> “ ‘You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean. You shall not make yourselves abominable by animal, or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems, which I have separated from you as unclean for you.   <span class="verse">26</span> You shall be holy to me, for I, Yahweh, am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples, that you should be mine.  <span class="verse">27</span> “ ‘A man or a woman that is a medium or is a wizard shall surely be put to death. They shall be stoned with stones. Their blood shall be upon themselves.’ ”   <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them, ‘A priest shall not defile himself for the dead among his people,   <span class="verse">2</span> except for his relatives that are near to him: for his mother, for his father, for his son, for his daughter, for his brother,   <span class="verse">3</span> and for his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband; for her he may defile himself.   <span class="verse">4</span> He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.  <span class="verse">5</span> “ ‘They shall not shave their heads or shave off the corners of their beards or make any cuttings in their flesh.   <span class="verse">6</span> They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of their God, for they offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, the bread of their God. Therefore they shall be holy.  <span class="verse">7</span> “ ‘They shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute, or profane. A priest shall not marry a woman divorced from her husband; for he is holy to his God.   <span class="verse">8</span> Therefore you shall sanctify him, for he offers the bread of your God. He shall be holy to you, for I Yahweh, who sanctify you, am holy.  <span class="verse">9</span> “ ‘The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the prostitute, she profanes her father. She shall be burned with fire.  <span class="verse">10</span> “ ‘He who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and who is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose, or tear his clothes.   <span class="verse">11</span> He must not go in to any dead body, or defile himself for his father or for his mother.   <span class="verse">12</span> He shall not go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am Yahweh.  <span class="verse">13</span> “ ‘He shall take a wife in her virginity.   <span class="verse">14</span> He shall not marry a widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled, or a prostitute. He shall take a virgin of his own people as a wife.   <span class="verse">15</span> He shall not profane his offspring among his people, for I am Yahweh who sanctifies him.’ ”  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">17</span> “Say to Aaron, ‘None of your offspring throughout their generations who has a defect may approach to offer the bread of his God.   <span class="verse">18</span> For whatever man he is that has a defect, he shall not draw near: a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose, or any deformity,   <span class="verse">19</span> or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured hand,   <span class="verse">20</span> or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye, or an itching disease, or scabs, or who has damaged testicles.   <span class="verse">21</span> No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire. Since he has a defect, he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.   <span class="verse">22</span> He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy.   <span class="verse">23</span> He shall not come near to the veil, nor come near to the altar, because he has a defect; that he may not profane my sanctuaries, for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.’ ”  <span class="verse">24</span> So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel.

We haven’t been false to your covenant.  <span class="verse">18</span> Our heart has not turned back,  neither have our steps strayed from your path,  <span class="verse">19</span> though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals,  and covered us with the shadow of death.  <span class="verse">20</span> If we have forgotten the name of our God,  or spread out our hands to a strange god,  <span class="verse">21</span> won’t God search this out?  For he knows the secrets of the heart.  <span class="verse">22</span> Yes, for your sake we are killed all day long.  We are regarded as sheep for the slaughter.  <span class="verse">23</span> Wake up!  Why do you sleep, Lord? Arise!  Don’t reject us forever.  <span class="verse">24</span> Why do you hide your face,  and forget our affliction and our oppression?  <span class="verse">25</span> For our soul is bowed down to the dust.  Our body clings to the earth.  <span class="verse">26</span> Rise up to help us.  Redeem us for your loving kindness’ sake.

What then will we have?”  <span class="verse">28</span> Jesus said to them,  “Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory, you also will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.  <span class="verse">29</span> Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive one hundred times, and will inherit eternal life.  <span class="verse">30</span> But many will be last who are first; and first who are last.

		<span class="reference">Acts 27:13-26</span>  <span class="chapter">27</span><span class="verse">13</span> When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to shore.   <span class="verse">14</span> But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is called Euroclydon.  <span class="verse">15</span> When the ship was caught and couldn’t face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.   <span class="verse">16</span> Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.   <span class="verse">17</span> After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help reinforce the ship. Fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor, and so were driven along.   <span class="verse">18</span> As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they began to throw things overboard.   <span class="verse">19</span> On the third day, they threw out the ship’s tackle with their own hands.   <span class="verse">20</span> When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would be saved was now taken away.  <span class="verse">21</span> When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle of them, and said, “Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete and have gotten this injury and loss.   <span class="verse">22</span> Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.   <span class="verse">23</span> For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God whose I am and whom I serve,   <span class="verse">24</span> saying, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar. Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.’   <span class="verse">25</span> Therefore, sirs, cheer up! For I believe God, that it will be just as it has been spoken to me.   <span class="verse">26</span> But we must run aground on a certain island.”
