		<span class="reference">Exodus 24-25</span>  <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> He said to Moses, “Come up to Yahweh, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship from a distance.   <span class="verse">2</span> Moses alone shall come near to Yahweh, but they shall not come near. The people shall not go up with him.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Moses came and told the people all Yahweh’s words, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, “All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Moses wrote all Yahweh’s words, then rose up early in the morning and built an altar at the base of the mountain, with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.   <span class="verse">5</span> He sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of cattle to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">6</span> Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.   <span class="verse">7</span> He took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people, and they said, “We will do all that Yahweh has said, and be obedient.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, “Look, this is the blood of the covenant, which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up.   <span class="verse">10</span> They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was like a paved work of sapphire   stone, like the skies for clearness.   <span class="verse">11</span> He didn’t lay his hand on the nobles of the children of Israel. They saw God, and ate and drank.  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain, and stay here, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commands that I have written, that you may teach them.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Moses rose up with Joshua, his servant, and Moses went up onto God’s Mountain.   <span class="verse">14</span> He said to the elders, “Wait here for us, until we come again to you. Behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.   <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh’s glory settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. The seventh day he called to Moses out of the middle of the cloud.   <span class="verse">17</span> The appearance of Yahweh’s glory was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">18</span> Moses entered into the middle of the cloud, and went up on the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.   <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, that they take an offering for me. From everyone whose heart makes him willing you shall take my offering.   <span class="verse">3</span> This is the offering which you shall take from them: gold, silver, bronze,   <span class="verse">4</span> blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats’ hair,   <span class="verse">5</span> rams’ skins dyed red, sea cow hides,  acacia wood,   <span class="verse">6</span> oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense,   <span class="verse">7</span> onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and for the breastplate.   <span class="verse">8</span> Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.   <span class="verse">9</span> According to all that I show you, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all of its furniture, even so you shall make it.  <span class="verse">10</span> “They shall make an ark of acacia wood. Its length shall be two and a half cubits,  its width a cubit and a half, and a cubit and a half its height.   <span class="verse">11</span> You shall overlay it with pure gold. You shall overlay it inside and outside, and you shall make a gold molding around it.   <span class="verse">12</span> You shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in its four feet. Two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.   <span class="verse">13</span> You shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.   <span class="verse">14</span> You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark.   <span class="verse">15</span> The poles shall be in the rings of the ark. They shall not be taken from it.   <span class="verse">16</span> You shall put the covenant which I shall give you into the ark.   <span class="verse">17</span> You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold. Two and a half cubits shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its width.   <span class="verse">18</span> You shall make two cherubim of hammered gold. You shall make them at the two ends of the mercy seat.   <span class="verse">19</span> Make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end. You shall make the cherubim on its two ends of one piece with the mercy seat.   <span class="verse">20</span> The cherubim shall spread out their wings upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward one another. The faces of the cherubim shall be toward the mercy seat.   <span class="verse">21</span> You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the covenant that I will give you.   <span class="verse">22</span> There I will meet with you, and I will tell you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the covenant, all that I command you for the children of Israel.  <span class="verse">23</span> “You shall make a table of acacia wood. Its length shall be two cubits, and its width a cubit, and its height one and a half cubits.   <span class="verse">24</span> You shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a gold molding around it.   <span class="verse">25</span> You shall make a rim of a hand width around it. You shall make a golden molding on its rim around it.   <span class="verse">26</span> You shall make four rings of gold for it, and put the rings in the four corners that are on its four feet.   <span class="verse">27</span> the rings shall be close to the rim, for places for the poles to carry the table.   <span class="verse">28</span> You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be carried with them.   <span class="verse">29</span> You shall make its dishes, its spoons, its ladles, and its bowls to pour out offerings with. You shall make them of pure gold.   <span class="verse">30</span> You shall set bread of the presence on the table before me always.  <span class="verse">31</span> “You shall make a lamp stand of pure gold. The lamp stand shall be made of hammered work. Its base, its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its flowers shall be of one piece with it.   <span class="verse">32</span> There shall be six branches going out of its sides: three branches of the lamp stand out of its one side, and three branches of the lamp stand out of its other side;   <span class="verse">33</span> three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch, a bud and a flower; and three cups made like almond blossoms in the other branch, a bud and a flower, so for the six branches going out of the lamp stand;   <span class="verse">34</span> and in the lamp stand four cups made like almond blossoms, its buds and its flowers;   <span class="verse">35</span> and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the lamp stand.   <span class="verse">36</span> Their buds and their branches shall be of one piece with it, all of it one beaten work of pure gold.   <span class="verse">37</span> You shall make its lamps seven, and they shall light its lamps to give light to the space in front of it.   <span class="verse">38</span> Its snuffers and its snuff dishes shall be of pure gold.   <span class="verse">39</span> It shall be made of a talent  of pure gold, with all these accessories.   <span class="verse">40</span> See that you make them after their pattern, which has been shown to you on the mountain.

My strength was sapped in the heat of summer.  <span class="verse">5</span> I acknowledged my sin to you.  I didn’t hide my iniquity.  I said, I will confess my transgressions to Yahweh,  and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.  <span class="verse">6</span> For this, let everyone who is godly pray to you in a time when you may be found.  Surely when the great waters overflow, they shall not reach to him.  <span class="verse">7</span> You are my hiding place.  You will preserve me from trouble.  You will surround me with songs of deliverance.  <span class="verse">8</span> I will instruct you and teach you in the way which you shall go.  I will counsel you with my eye on you.  <span class="verse">9</span> Don’t be like the horse, or like the mule, which have no understanding,  who are controlled by bit and bridle, or else they will not come near to you.  <span class="verse">10</span> Many sorrows come to the wicked,  but loving kindness shall surround him who trusts in Yahweh.  <span class="verse">11</span> Be glad in Yahweh, and rejoice, you righteous!  Shout for joy, all you who are upright in heart!

They sat down, and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.  <span class="verse">49</span> So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,  <span class="verse">50</span> and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.” <span class="verse">51</span> Jesus said to them,  “Have you understood all these things?”  They answered him, “Yes, Lord.”  <span class="verse">52</span> He said to them,  “Therefore every scribe who has been made a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who is a householder, who brings out of his treasure new and old things.” <span class="verse">53</span> When Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.   <span class="verse">54</span> Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom, and these mighty works?   <span class="verse">55</span> Isn’t this the carpenter’s son?

But Jesus said to them,  “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.” <span class="verse">58</span> He didn’t do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.

As Paul spoke still longer, being weighed down by his sleep, he fell down from the third floor and was taken up dead.   <span class="verse">10</span> Paul went down and fell upon him, and embracing him said, “Don’t be troubled, for his life is in him.”  <span class="verse">11</span> When he had gone up, and had broken bread and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, he departed.   <span class="verse">12</span> They brought the boy in alive, and were greatly comforted.
