		<span class="reference">Exodus 30-31</span>  <span class="chapter">30</span><span class="verse">1</span> “You shall make an altar to burn incense on. You shall make it of acacia wood.   <span class="verse">2</span> Its length shall be a cubit,  and its width a cubit. It shall be square, and its height shall be two cubits. Its horns shall be of one piece with it.   <span class="verse">3</span> You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top, its sides around it, and its horns; and you shall make a gold molding around it.   <span class="verse">4</span> You shall make two golden rings for it under its molding; on its two ribs, on its two sides you shall make them; and they shall be for places for poles with which to bear it.   <span class="verse">5</span> You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.   <span class="verse">6</span> You shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the covenant, before the mercy seat that is over the covenant, where I will meet with you.   <span class="verse">7</span> Aaron shall burn incense of sweet spices on it every morning. When he tends the lamps, he shall burn it.   <span class="verse">8</span> When Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Yahweh throughout your generations.   <span class="verse">9</span> You shall offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt offering, nor meal offering; and you shall pour no drink offering on it.   <span class="verse">10</span> Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once in the year; with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once in the year he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations. It is most holy to Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">12</span> “When you take a census of the children of Israel, according to those who are counted among them, then each man shall give a ransom for his soul to Yahweh, when you count them; that there be no plague among them when you count them.   <span class="verse">13</span> They shall give this, everyone who passes over to those who are counted, half a shekel according to the shekel  of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs ); half a shekel for an offering to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">14</span> Everyone who passes over to those who are counted, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">15</span> The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel,  when they give the offering of Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls.   <span class="verse">16</span> You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shall appoint it for the service of the Tent of Meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh, to make atonement for your souls.”  <span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">18</span> “You shall also make a basin of bronze, and its base of bronze, in which to wash. You shall put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.   <span class="verse">19</span> Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.   <span class="verse">20</span> When they go into the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, that they not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">21</span> So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die. This shall be a statute forever to them, even to him and to his descendants throughout their generations.”  <span class="verse">22</span> Moreover Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">23</span> “Also take fine spices: of liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels;  and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty; and of fragrant cane, two hundred and fifty;   <span class="verse">24</span> and of cassia five hundred, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; and a hin  of olive oil.   <span class="verse">25</span> You shall make it into a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.   <span class="verse">26</span> You shall use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the covenant,   <span class="verse">27</span> the table and all its articles, the lamp stand and its accessories, the altar of incense,   <span class="verse">28</span> the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its base.   <span class="verse">29</span> You shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy.   <span class="verse">30</span> You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister to me in the priest’s office.   <span class="verse">31</span> You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘This shall be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.   <span class="verse">32</span> It shall not be poured on man’s flesh, and do not make any like it, according to its composition. It is holy. It shall be holy to you.   <span class="verse">33</span> Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.’ ”  <span class="verse">34</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin, onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense. There shall be an equal weight of each.   <span class="verse">35</span> You shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy.   <span class="verse">36</span> You shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before the covenant in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be to you most holy.   <span class="verse">37</span> The incense which you shall make, according to its composition you shall not make for yourselves: it shall be to you holy for Yahweh.   <span class="verse">38</span> Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall be cut off from his people.”   <span class="chapter">31</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.   <span class="verse">3</span> I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship,   <span class="verse">4</span> to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze,   <span class="verse">5</span> and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship.   <span class="verse">6</span> Behold, I myself have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:   <span class="verse">7</span> the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,   <span class="verse">8</span> the table and its vessels, the pure lamp stand with all its vessels, the altar of incense,   <span class="verse">9</span> the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base,   <span class="verse">10</span> the finely worked garments—the holy garments for Aaron the priest, the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office—   <span class="verse">11</span> the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse">13</span> “Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths; for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.   <span class="verse">14</span> You shall keep the Sabbath therefore, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.   <span class="verse">15</span> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.   <span class="verse">16</span> Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.   <span class="verse">17</span> It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’ ”  <span class="verse">18</span> When he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, he gave Moses the two tablets of the covenant, stone tablets, written with God’s finger.

		<span class="reference">Psalms 35:1-14</span>  <span class="chapter">35</span><span class="verse">1</span> Contend, Yahweh, with those who contend with me.  Fight against those who fight against me.  <span class="verse">2</span> Take hold of shield and buckler,  and stand up for my help.  <span class="verse">3</span> Brandish the spear and block those who pursue me.  Tell my soul, “I am your salvation.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Let those who seek after my soul be disappointed and brought to dishonor.  Let those who plot my ruin be turned back and confounded.  <span class="verse">5</span> Let them be as chaff before the wind,  Yahweh’s angel driving them on.  <span class="verse">6</span> Let their way be dark and slippery,  Yahweh’s angel pursuing them.  <span class="verse">7</span> For without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me.  Without cause they have dug a pit for my soul.  <span class="verse">8</span> Let destruction come on him unawares.  Let his net that he has hidden catch himself.  Let him fall into that destruction.  <span class="verse">9</span> My soul shall be joyful in Yahweh.  It shall rejoice in his salvation.  <span class="verse">10</span> All my bones shall say, “Yahweh, who is like you,  who delivers the poor from him who is too strong for him;  yes, the poor and the needy from him who robs him?”  <span class="verse">11</span> Unrighteous witnesses rise up.  They ask me about things that I don’t know about.  <span class="verse">12</span> They reward me evil for good,  to the bereaving of my soul.  <span class="verse">13</span> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth.  I afflicted my soul with fasting.  My prayer returned into my own bosom.  <span class="verse">14</span> I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother.  I bowed down mourning, as one who mourns his mother.

		<span class="reference">Matthew 15:1-20</span>  <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”  <span class="verse">3</span> He answered them,  “Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?  <span class="verse">4</span> For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’ <span class="verse">5</span> But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”  <span class="verse">6</span> he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.  <span class="verse">7</span> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, <span class="verse">8</span> ‘These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. <span class="verse">9</span> And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’ ” <span class="verse">10</span> He summoned the multitude, and said to them,  “Hear, and understand.  <span class="verse">11</span> That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.” <span class="verse">12</span> Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”  <span class="verse">13</span> But he answered,  “Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.  <span class="verse">14</span> Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.” <span class="verse">15</span> Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”  <span class="verse">16</span> So Jesus said,  “Do you also still not understand?  <span class="verse">17</span> Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?  <span class="verse">18</span> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.  <span class="verse">19</span> For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.  <span class="verse">20</span> These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”

		<span class="reference">Acts 21:15-26</span>  <span class="chapter">21</span><span class="verse">15</span> After these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">16</span> Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us, bringing one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we would stay.  <span class="verse">17</span> When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.   <span class="verse">18</span> The day following, Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.   <span class="verse">19</span> When he had greeted them, he reported one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.   <span class="verse">20</span> They, when they heard it, glorified God. They said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.   <span class="verse">21</span> They have been informed about you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children and not to walk after the customs.   <span class="verse">22</span> What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.   <span class="verse">23</span> Therefore do what we tell you. We have four men who have taken a vow.   <span class="verse">24</span> Take them and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses for them, that they may shave their heads. Then all will know that there is no truth in the things that they have been informed about you, but that you yourself also walk keeping the law.   <span class="verse">25</span> But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols, from blood, from strangled things, and from sexual immorality.”  <span class="verse">26</span> Then Paul took the men, and the next day purified himself and went with them into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.
