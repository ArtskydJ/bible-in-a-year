They also gave food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus King of Persia.  <span class="verse">8</span> Now in the second year of their coming to God’s house at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">9</span> Then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to have the oversight of the workmen in God’s house: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brothers the Levites.   <span class="verse">10</span> When the builders laid the foundation of Yahweh’s temple, they set the priests in their clothing with trumpets, with the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Yahweh, according to the directions of David king of Israel.   <span class="verse">11</span> They sang to one another in praising and giving thanks to Yahweh, “For he is good, for his loving kindness endures forever toward Israel.” All the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised Yahweh, because the foundation of Yahweh’s house had been laid.  <span class="verse">12</span> But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households, the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. Many also shouted aloud for joy,   <span class="verse">13</span> so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard far away.

		<span class="reference">Proverbs 2</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> My son, if you will receive my words,  and store up my commandments within you,  <span class="verse">2</span> so as to turn your ear to wisdom,  and apply your heart to understanding;  <span class="verse">3</span> yes, if you call out for discernment,  and lift up your voice for understanding;  <span class="verse">4</span> if you seek her as silver,  and search for her as for hidden treasures:  <span class="verse">5</span> then you will understand the fear of Yahweh,  and find the knowledge of God. <span class="verse">6</span> For Yahweh gives wisdom.  Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.  <span class="verse">7</span> He lays up sound wisdom for the upright.  He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,  <span class="verse">8</span> that he may guard the paths of justice,  and preserve the way of his saints.  <span class="verse">9</span> Then you will understand righteousness and justice,  equity and every good path.  <span class="verse">10</span> For wisdom will enter into your heart.  Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.  <span class="verse">11</span> Discretion will watch over you.  Understanding will keep you,  <span class="verse">12</span> to deliver you from the way of evil,  from the men who speak perverse things,  <span class="verse">13</span> who forsake the paths of uprightness,  to walk in the ways of darkness,  <span class="verse">14</span> who rejoice to do evil,  and delight in the perverseness of evil,  <span class="verse">15</span> who are crooked in their ways,  and wayward in their paths,  <span class="verse">16</span> to deliver you from the strange woman,  even from the foreigner who flatters with her words,  <span class="verse">17</span> who forsakes the friend of her youth,  and forgets the covenant of her God;  <span class="verse">18</span> for her house leads down to death,  her paths to the departed spirits.  <span class="verse">19</span> None who go to her return again,  neither do they attain to the paths of life.  <span class="verse">20</span> So you may walk in the way of good men,  and keep the paths of the righteous.  <span class="verse">21</span> For the upright will dwell in the land.  The perfect will remain in it.  <span class="verse">22</span> But the wicked will be cut off from the land.  The treacherous will be rooted out of it.

Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.’  <span class="verse">28</span> There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in God’s Kingdom, and yourselves being thrown outside.  <span class="verse">29</span> They will come from the east, west, north, and south, and will sit down in God’s Kingdom.  <span class="verse">30</span> Behold, there are some who are last who will be first, and there are some who are first who will be last.”
