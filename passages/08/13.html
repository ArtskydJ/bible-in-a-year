Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?  <span class="verse">2</span> On the top of high places by the way,  where the paths meet, she stands.  <span class="verse">3</span> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,  at the entry doors, she cries aloud:  <span class="verse">4</span> “I call to you men!  I send my voice to the sons of mankind.  <span class="verse">5</span> You simple, understand prudence!  You fools, be of an understanding heart!  <span class="verse">6</span> Hear, for I will speak excellent things.  The opening of my lips is for right things.  <span class="verse">7</span> For my mouth speaks truth.  Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  <span class="verse">8</span> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.  There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.  <span class="verse">9</span> They are all plain to him who understands,  right to those who find knowledge.  <span class="verse">10</span> Receive my instruction rather than silver,  knowledge rather than choice gold.  <span class="verse">11</span> For wisdom is better than rubies.  All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.  <span class="verse">12</span> “I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling.  Find out knowledge and discretion.  <span class="verse">13</span> The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil.  I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.  <span class="verse">14</span> Counsel and sound knowledge are mine.  I have understanding and power.  <span class="verse">15</span> By me kings reign,  and princes decree justice.  <span class="verse">16</span> By me princes rule,  nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.  <span class="verse">17</span> I love those who love me.  Those who seek me diligently will find me.  <span class="verse">18</span> With me are riches, honor,  enduring wealth, and prosperity.  <span class="verse">19</span> My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold,  my yield than choice silver.  <span class="verse">20</span> I walk in the way of righteousness,  in the middle of the paths of justice,  <span class="verse">21</span> that I may give wealth to those who love me.  I fill their treasuries.

He who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.  <span class="verse">11</span> If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?  <span class="verse">12</span> If you have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own?  <span class="verse">13</span> No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. You aren’t able to serve God and Mammon.” <span class="verse">14</span> The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they scoffed at him.   <span class="verse">15</span> He said to them,  “You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts. For that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.  <span class="verse">16</span> The law and the prophets were until John. From that time the Good News of God’s Kingdom is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.  <span class="verse">17</span> But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tiny stroke of a pen in the law to fall.  <span class="verse">18</span> Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery. He who marries one who is divorced from a husband commits adultery.

Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.   <span class="verse">13</span> I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession,   <span class="verse">14</span> that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,   <span class="verse">15</span> which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords.   <span class="verse">16</span> He alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and eternal power.
