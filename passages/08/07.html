He was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to Yahweh his God’s hand on him.   <span class="verse">7</span> Some of the children of Israel, including some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.   <span class="verse">8</span> He came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.   <span class="verse">9</span> For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.   <span class="verse">10</span> For Ezra had set his heart to seek Yahweh’s law, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.  <span class="verse">11</span> Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of Yahweh’s commandments, and of his statutes to Israel:  <span class="verse">12</span> Artaxerxes, king of kings,  To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the perfect God of heaven.  Now   <span class="verse">13</span> I make a decree, that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who intend of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with you.   <span class="verse">14</span> Because you are sent by the king and his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand,   <span class="verse">15</span> and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,   <span class="verse">16</span> and all the silver and gold that you will find in all the province of Babylon, with the free will offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;   <span class="verse">17</span> therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">18</span> Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do that according to the will of your God.   <span class="verse">19</span> The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">20</span> Whatever more will be needed for the house of your God, which you may have occasion to give, give it out of the king’s treasure house.  <span class="verse">21</span> I, even I Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done with all diligence,   <span class="verse">22</span> up to one hundred talents  of silver, and to one hundred cors  of wheat, and to one hundred baths  of wine, and to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.   <span class="verse">23</span> Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?  <span class="verse">24</span> Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or laborers of this house of God.  <span class="verse">25</span> You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, who all know the laws of your God; and teach him who doesn’t know them.   <span class="verse">26</span> Whoever will not do the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with all diligence, whether it is to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.  <span class="verse">27</span> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to beautify Yahweh’s house which is in Jerusalem;   <span class="verse">28</span> and has extended loving kindness to me before the king and his counselors, and before all the king’s mighty princes. I was strengthened according to Yahweh my God’s hand on me, and I gathered together chief men out of Israel to go up with me.

Don’t walk in the way of evil men.  <span class="verse">15</span> Avoid it, and don’t pass by it.  Turn from it, and pass on.  <span class="verse">16</span> For they don’t sleep unless they do evil.  Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.  <span class="verse">17</span> For they eat the bread of wickedness  and drink the wine of violence.  <span class="verse">18</span> But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light  that shines more and more until the perfect day.  <span class="verse">19</span> The way of the wicked is like darkness.  They don’t know what they stumble over.  <span class="verse">20</span> My son, attend to my words.  Turn your ear to my sayings.  <span class="verse">21</span> Let them not depart from your eyes.  Keep them in the center of your heart.  <span class="verse">22</span> For they are life to those who find them,  and health to their whole body.  <span class="verse">23</span> Keep your heart with all diligence,  for out of it is the wellspring of life.  <span class="verse">24</span> Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.

Let all of your ways be established.  <span class="verse">27</span> Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left.  Remove your foot from evil.
