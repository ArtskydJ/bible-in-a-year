Sheshbazzar brought all these up when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.

Let’s lay in wait for blood.  Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause.  <span class="verse">12</span> Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those who go down into the pit.  <span class="verse">13</span> We’ll find all valuable wealth.  We’ll fill our houses with plunder.  <span class="verse">14</span> You shall cast your lot among us.  We’ll all have one purse.”  <span class="verse">15</span> My son, don’t walk on the path with them.  Keep your foot from their path,  <span class="verse">16</span> for their feet run to evil.  They hurry to shed blood.  <span class="verse">17</span> For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird;  <span class="verse">18</span> but these lay in wait for their own blood.  They lurk secretly for their own lives.  <span class="verse">19</span> So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain.  It takes away the life of its owners.

Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?’  <span class="verse">8</span> He answered, ‘Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.  <span class="verse">9</span> If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.’ ”
