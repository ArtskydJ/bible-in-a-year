This work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">9</span> Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?”  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">10</span> We asked them their names also, to inform you that we might write the names of the men who were at their head.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">11</span> Thus they returned us answer, saying, “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">12</span> But after our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">13</span> But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">14</span> The gold and silver vessels of God’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king also took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor.  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">15</span> He said to him, ‘Take these vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let God’s house be built in its place.’  </span> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">16</span> Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of God’s house which is in Jerusalem. Since that time even until now it has been being built, and yet it is not completed. </span> </span> <span class="paragraph"> <span class="paragraphtext"><span class="verse">17</span> Now therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king’s treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.” </span> </span>
