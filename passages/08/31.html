		<span class="reference">Esther 9-10</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king’s commandment and his decree came near to be put in execution, on the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it was turned out the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated them),   <span class="verse">2</span> the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them. No one could withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.   <span class="verse">3</span> All the princes of the provinces, the local governors, the governors, and those who did the king’s business helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them.   <span class="verse">4</span> For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces; for the man Mordecai grew greater and greater.   <span class="verse">5</span> The Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated them.   <span class="verse">6</span> In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.   <span class="verse">7</span> They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,   <span class="verse">8</span> Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,   <span class="verse">9</span> Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,   <span class="verse">10</span> the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.  <span class="verse">11</span> On that day, the number of those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.   <span class="verse">12</span> The king said to Esther the queen, “The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the gallows.”  <span class="verse">14</span> The king commanded this to be done. A decree was given out in Susa; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.   <span class="verse">15</span> The Jews who were in Susa gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and killed three hundred men in Susa; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.   <span class="verse">16</span> The other Jews who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, defended their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they didn’t lay their hand on the plunder.  <span class="verse">17</span> This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness.   <span class="verse">18</span> But the Jews who were in Susa assembled together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.   <span class="verse">19</span> Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and a day of sending presents of food to one another.  <span class="verse">20</span> Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,   <span class="verse">21</span> to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly,   <span class="verse">22</span> as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.   <span class="verse">23</span> The Jews accepted the custom that they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them;   <span class="verse">24</span> because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast “Pur”, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;   <span class="verse">25</span> but when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked plan, which he had planned against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.  <span class="verse">26</span> Therefore they called these days “Purim”,  from the word “Pur.” Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,   <span class="verse">27</span> the Jews established and imposed on themselves, and on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to what was written, and according to its appointed time, every year;   <span class="verse">28</span> and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor their memory perish from their offspring, <span class="verse">29</span> Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.   <span class="verse">30</span> He sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,   <span class="verse">31</span> to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed, and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants, in the matter of the fastings and their cry.   <span class="verse">32</span> The commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.   <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> King Ahasuerus laid a tribute on the land, and on the islands of the sea.   <span class="verse">2</span> All the acts of his power and of his might, and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, to which the king advanced him, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?   <span class="verse">3</span> For Mordecai the Jew was next to King Ahasuerus, and great among the Jews, and accepted by the multitude of his brothers, seeking the good of his people, and speaking peace to all his descendants.

One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.  <span class="verse">20</span> One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity,  and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.  <span class="verse">21</span> He who becomes the father of a fool grieves.  The father of a fool has no joy.  <span class="verse">22</span> A cheerful heart makes good medicine,  but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.  <span class="verse">23</span> A wicked man receives a bribe in secret,  to pervert the ways of justice.  <span class="verse">24</span> Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding,  but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse">25</span> A foolish son brings grief to his father,  and bitterness to her who bore him.  <span class="verse">26</span> Also to punish the righteous is not good,  nor to flog officials for their integrity.  <span class="verse">27</span> He who spares his words has knowledge.  He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.  <span class="verse">28</span> Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise.  When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.

Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,   <span class="verse">13</span> whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.   <span class="verse">14</span> But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.   <span class="verse">15</span> For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,   <span class="verse">16</span> no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.  <span class="verse">17</span> If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.   <span class="verse">18</span> But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.   <span class="verse">19</span> I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).   <span class="verse">20</span> Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord.
