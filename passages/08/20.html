No one is good, except one: God.  <span class="verse">20</span> You know the commandments: ‘Don’t commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t steal,’ ‘Don’t give false testimony,’ ‘Honor your father and your mother.’ ” <span class="verse">21</span> He said, “I have observed all these things from my youth up.”  <span class="verse">22</span> When Jesus heard these things, he said to him,  “You still lack one thing. Sell all that you have, and distribute it to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.” <span class="verse">23</span> But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was very rich.  <span class="verse">24</span> Jesus, seeing that he became very sad, said,  “How hard it is for those who have riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!  <span class="verse">25</span> For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”

Turn away from these, also.   <span class="verse">6</span> For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,   <span class="verse">7</span> always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.   <span class="verse">8</span> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected.   <span class="verse">9</span> But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.
