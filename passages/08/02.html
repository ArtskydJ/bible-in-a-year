<span class="verse">58</span> All the temple servants, and the children of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred ninety-two.  <span class="verse">59</span> These were those who went up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers’ houses, and their offspring,  whether they were of Israel:   <span class="verse">60</span> the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred fifty-two.   <span class="verse">61</span> Of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Hakkoz, and the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.   <span class="verse">62</span> These sought their place among those who were registered by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they deemed disqualified and removed from the priesthood.   <span class="verse">63</span> The governor told them that they should not eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up to serve with Urim and with Thummim.  <span class="verse">64</span> The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,   <span class="verse">65</span> in addition to their male servants and their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven; and they had two hundred singing men and singing women.   <span class="verse">66</span> Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six; their mules, two hundred forty-five;   <span class="verse">67</span> their camels, four hundred thirty-five; their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred twenty.  <span class="verse">68</span> Some of the heads of fathers’ households, when they came to Yahweh’s house which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly for God’s house to set it up in its place.   <span class="verse">69</span> They gave according to their ability into the treasury of the work sixty-one thousand darics of gold,  and five thousand minas  of silver, and one hundred priests’ garments.  <span class="verse">70</span> So the priests and the Levites, with some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants, lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.

		<span class="reference">Proverbs 1:20-33</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">20</span> Wisdom calls aloud in the street.  She utters her voice in the public squares.  <span class="verse">21</span> She calls at the head of noisy places.  At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:  <span class="verse">22</span> “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity?  How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery,  and fools hate knowledge?  <span class="verse">23</span> Turn at my reproof.  Behold,  I will pour out my spirit on you.  I will make known my words to you.  <span class="verse">24</span> Because I have called, and you have refused;  I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;  <span class="verse">25</span> but you have ignored all my counsel,  and wanted none of my reproof;  <span class="verse">26</span> I also will laugh at your disaster.  I will mock when calamity overtakes you,  <span class="verse">27</span> when calamity overtakes you like a storm,  when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind,  when distress and anguish come on you.  <span class="verse">28</span> Then they will call on me, but I will not answer.  They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;  <span class="verse">29</span> because they hated knowledge,  and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.  <span class="verse">30</span> They wanted none of my counsel.  They despised all my reproof.  <span class="verse">31</span> Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way,  and be filled with their own schemes.  <span class="verse">32</span> For the backsliding of the simple will kill them.  The careless ease of fools will destroy them.  <span class="verse">33</span> But whoever listens to me will dwell securely,  and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”

She was bent over, and could in no way straighten herself up.   <span class="verse">12</span> When Jesus saw her, he called her, and said to her,  “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.” <span class="verse">13</span> He laid his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight and glorified God.  <span class="verse">14</span> The ruler of the synagogue, being indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the multitude, “There are six days in which men ought to work. Therefore come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day!”  <span class="verse">15</span> Therefore the Lord answered him,  “You hypocrites! Doesn’t each one of you free his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath, and lead him away to water?  <span class="verse">16</span> Ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham whom Satan had bound eighteen long years, be freed from this bondage on the Sabbath day?”  <span class="verse">17</span> As he said these things, all his adversaries were disappointed and all the multitude rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.  <span class="verse">18</span> He said,  “What is God’s Kingdom like? To what shall I compare it?  <span class="verse">19</span> It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his own garden. It grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the sky live in its branches.” <span class="verse">20</span> Again he said,  “To what shall I compare God’s Kingdom?  <span class="verse">21</span> It is like yeast, which a woman took and hid in three measures  of flour, until it was all leavened.”

However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.   <span class="verse">14</span> The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.   <span class="verse">15</span> The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.   <span class="verse">16</span> However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.   <span class="verse">17</span> Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.  <span class="verse">18</span> I commit this instruction to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which were given to you before, that by them you may wage the good warfare,   <span class="verse">19</span> holding faith and a good conscience, which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith,   <span class="verse">20</span> of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.
