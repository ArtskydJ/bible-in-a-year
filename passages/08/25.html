		<span class="reference">Esther 2</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.   <span class="verse">2</span> Then the king’s servants who served him said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.   <span class="verse">3</span> Let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women’s house, to the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let cosmetics be given them;   <span class="verse">4</span> and let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The thing pleased the king, and he did so.  <span class="verse">5</span> There was a certain Jew in the citadel of Susa, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,   <span class="verse">6</span> who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.   <span class="verse">7</span> He brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead, Mordecai took her for his own daughter.  <span class="verse">8</span> So, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, Esther was taken into the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.   <span class="verse">9</span> The maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the king’s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the women’s house.   <span class="verse">10</span> Esther had not made known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her that she should not make it known.   <span class="verse">11</span> Mordecai walked every day in front of the court of the women’s house, to find out how Esther was doing, and what would become of her.  <span class="verse">12</span> Each young woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and with preparations for beautifying women).   <span class="verse">13</span> The young woman then came to the king like this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women’s house to the king’s house.   <span class="verse">14</span> In the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.   <span class="verse">15</span> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor in the sight of all those who looked at her.  <span class="verse">16</span> So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.   <span class="verse">17</span> The king loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.  <span class="verse">18</span> Then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s bounty.  <span class="verse">19</span> When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate.   <span class="verse">20</span> Esther had not yet made known her relatives nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him.   <span class="verse">21</span> In those days, while Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.   <span class="verse">22</span> This thing became known to Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in Mordecai’s name.   <span class="verse">23</span> When this matter was investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s presence.

		<span class="reference">Proverbs 14:19-35</span>  <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">19</span> The evil bow down before the good,  and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.  <span class="verse">20</span> The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbor,  but the rich person has many friends.  <span class="verse">21</span> He who despises his neighbor sins,  but he who has pity on the poor is blessed.  <span class="verse">22</span> Don’t they go astray who plot evil?  But love and faithfulness belong to those who plan good.  <span class="verse">23</span> In all hard work there is profit,  but the talk of the lips leads only to poverty.  <span class="verse">24</span> The crown of the wise is their riches,  but the folly of fools crowns them with folly.  <span class="verse">25</span> A truthful witness saves souls,  but a false witness is deceitful.  <span class="verse">26</span> In the fear of Yahweh is a secure fortress,  and he will be a refuge for his children.  <span class="verse">27</span> The fear of Yahweh is a fountain of life,  turning people from the snares of death.  <span class="verse">28</span> In the multitude of people is the king’s glory,  but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince.  <span class="verse">29</span> He who is slow to anger has great understanding,  but he who has a quick temper displays folly.  <span class="verse">30</span> The life of the body is a heart at peace,  but envy rots the bones.  <span class="verse">31</span> He who oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker,  but he who is kind to the needy honors him.  <span class="verse">32</span> The wicked is brought down in his calamity,  but in death, the righteous has a refuge.  <span class="verse">33</span> Wisdom rests in the heart of one who has understanding,  and is even made known in the inward part of fools.  <span class="verse">34</span> Righteousness exalts a nation,  but sin is a disgrace to any people.  <span class="verse">35</span> The king’s favor is toward a servant who deals wisely,  but his wrath is toward one who causes shame.

Untie it and bring it.  <span class="verse">31</span> If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ say to him: ‘The Lord needs it.’ ” <span class="verse">32</span> Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them.   <span class="verse">33</span> As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”   <span class="verse">34</span> They said, “The Lord needs it.”   <span class="verse">35</span> Then they brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and sat Jesus on them.   <span class="verse">36</span> As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road.   <span class="verse">37</span> As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen,   <span class="verse">38</span> saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!   Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!”

		<span class="reference">Titus 1:10-16</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">10</span> For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,   <span class="verse">11</span> whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.   <span class="verse">12</span> One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”   <span class="verse">13</span> This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,   <span class="verse">14</span> not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.   <span class="verse">15</span> To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.   <span class="verse">16</span> They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
