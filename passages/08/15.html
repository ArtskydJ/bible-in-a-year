		<span class="reference">Nehemiah 5</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.   <span class="verse">2</span> For there were some who said, “We, our sons and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”   <span class="verse">3</span> There were also some who said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get grain, because of the famine.”   <span class="verse">4</span> There were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute using our fields and our vineyards as collateral.   <span class="verse">5</span> Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children. Behold,  we bring our sons and our daughters into bondage to be servants, and some of our daughters have been brought into bondage. It is also not in our power to help it, because other men have our fields and our vineyards.”  <span class="verse">6</span> I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.   <span class="verse">7</span> Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great assembly against them.   <span class="verse">8</span> I said to them, “We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found not a word to say.   <span class="verse">9</span> Also I said, “The thing that you do is not good. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?   <span class="verse">10</span> I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain. Please let us stop this usury.   <span class="verse">11</span> Please restore to them, even today, their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Then they said, “We will restore them, and will require nothing of them. We will do so, even as you say.”  Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.   <span class="verse">13</span> Also I shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that doesn’t perform this promise; even may he be shaken out and emptied like this.”  All the assembly said, “Amen,” and praised Yahweh. The people did according to this promise.  <span class="verse">14</span> Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.   <span class="verse">15</span> But the former governors who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine from them, plus forty shekels  of silver; yes, even their servants ruled over the people; but I didn’t do so, because of the fear of God.   <span class="verse">16</span> Yes, I also continued in the work of this wall. We didn’t buy any land. All my servants were gathered there to the work.   <span class="verse">17</span> Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty men, in addition to those who came to us from among the nations that were around us.   <span class="verse">18</span> Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine. Yet for all this, I didn’t demand the governor’s pay, because the bondage was heavy on this people.   <span class="verse">19</span> Remember me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.

She has carved out her seven pillars.  <span class="verse">2</span> She has prepared her meat.  She has mixed her wine.  She has also set her table.  <span class="verse">3</span> She has sent out her maidens.  She cries from the highest places of the city:  <span class="verse">4</span> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”  As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,  <span class="verse">5</span> “Come, eat some of my bread,  Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!  <span class="verse">6</span> Leave your simple ways, and live.  Walk in the way of understanding.”  <span class="verse">7</span> One who corrects a mocker invites insult.  One who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.  <span class="verse">8</span> Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you.  Reprove a wise person, and he will love you.  <span class="verse">9</span> Instruct a wise person, and he will be still wiser.  Teach a righteous person, and he will increase in learning.  <span class="verse">10</span> The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.  The knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.  <span class="verse">11</span> For by me your days will be multiplied.  The years of your life will be increased.  <span class="verse">12</span> If you are wise, you are wise for yourself.  If you mock, you alone will bear it.  <span class="verse">13</span> The foolish woman is loud,  undisciplined, and knows nothing.  <span class="verse">14</span> She sits at the door of her house,  on a seat in the high places of the city,  <span class="verse">15</span> to call to those who pass by,  who go straight on their ways,  <span class="verse">16</span> “Whoever is simple, let him turn in here.”  as for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,  <span class="verse">17</span> “Stolen water is sweet.  Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”  <span class="verse">18</span> But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,  that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him.  <span class="verse">4</span> If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.” <span class="verse">5</span> The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.”  <span class="verse">6</span> The Lord said,  “If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.  <span class="verse">7</span> But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table,’  <span class="verse">8</span> and will not rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’?  <span class="verse">9</span> Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.  <span class="verse">10</span> Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’ ”

How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day   <span class="verse">4</span> longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy;   <span class="verse">5</span> having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also.  <span class="verse">6</span> For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.   <span class="verse">7</span> For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.
