		<span class="reference">Nehemiah 1</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah.  Now in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the palace,   <span class="verse">2</span> Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">3</span> They said to me, “The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”  <span class="verse">4</span> When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned several days; and I fasted and prayed before the God  of heaven,   <span class="verse">5</span> and said, “I beg you, Yahweh,  the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:   <span class="verse">6</span> Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father’s house have sinned.   <span class="verse">7</span> We have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your servant Moses.  <span class="verse">8</span> “Remember, I beg you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you trespass, I will scatter you among the peoples;   <span class="verse">9</span> but if you return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’  <span class="verse">10</span> “Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.   <span class="verse">11</span> Lord,  I beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who delight to fear your name; and please prosper your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”  Now I was cup bearer to the king.

Lay up my commandments within you.  <span class="verse">2</span> Keep my commandments and live!  Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.  <span class="verse">3</span> Bind them on your fingers.  Write them on the tablet of your heart.  <span class="verse">4</span> Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.”  Call understanding your relative,  <span class="verse">5</span> that they may keep you from the strange woman,  from the foreigner who flatters with her words.  <span class="verse">6</span> For at the window of my house,  I looked out through my lattice.  <span class="verse">7</span> I saw among the simple ones.  I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,  <span class="verse">8</span> passing through the street near her corner,  he went the way to her house,  <span class="verse">9</span> in the twilight, in the evening of the day,  in the middle of the night and in the darkness.  <span class="verse">10</span> Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,  and with crafty intent.  <span class="verse">11</span> She is loud and defiant.  Her feet don’t stay in her house.  <span class="verse">12</span> Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,  and lurking at every corner.  <span class="verse">13</span> So she caught him, and kissed him.  With an impudent face she said to him:  <span class="verse">14</span> “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me.  Today I have paid my vows.

But while he was still far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.  <span class="verse">21</span> The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ <span class="verse">22</span> “But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet.  <span class="verse">23</span> Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let’s eat, and celebrate;  <span class="verse">24</span> for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ Then they began to celebrate. <span class="verse">25</span> “Now his elder son was in the field. As he came near to the house, he heard music and dancing.  <span class="verse">26</span> He called one of the servants to him, and asked what was going on.  <span class="verse">27</span> He said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and healthy.’  <span class="verse">28</span> But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out, and begged him.  <span class="verse">29</span> But he answered his father, ‘Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.  <span class="verse">30</span> But when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him.’ <span class="verse">31</span> “He said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.  <span class="verse">32</span> But it was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again. He was lost, and is found.’ ”

Don’t be a participant in other people’s sins. Keep yourself pure.   <span class="verse">23</span> Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent infirmities.  <span class="verse">24</span> Some men’s sins are evident, preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later.   <span class="verse">25</span> In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden.
