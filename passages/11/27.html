		<span class="reference">Daniel 5-6</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.   <span class="verse">2</span> Belshazzar, while he tasted the wine, commanded that the golden and silver vessels which Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem be brought to him; that the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, might drink from them.   <span class="verse">3</span> Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God’s house which was at Jerusalem; and the king and his lords, his wives and his concubines, drank from them.   <span class="verse">4</span> They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of bronze, of iron, of wood, and of stone.  <span class="verse">5</span> In the same hour, the fingers of a man’s hand came out and wrote near the lamp stand on the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace. The king saw the part of the hand that wrote.   <span class="verse">6</span> Then the king’s face was changed in him, and his thoughts troubled him; and the joints of his thighs were loosened, and his knees struck one against another.  <span class="verse">7</span> The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing, and shows me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Then all the king’s wise men came in; but they could not read the writing, and couldn’t make known to the king the interpretation.   <span class="verse">9</span> Then king Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his face was changed in him, and his lords were perplexed.  <span class="verse">10</span> The queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house. The queen spoke and said, “O king, live forever; don’t let your thoughts trouble you, nor let your face be changed.   <span class="verse">11</span> There is a man in your kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, were found in him. The king Nebuchadnezzar your father, yes, the king, your father, made him master of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;   <span class="verse">12</span> because an excellent spirit, knowledge, understanding, interpreting of dreams, showing of dark sentences, and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Then Daniel was brought in before the king. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Are you that Daniel of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?   <span class="verse">14</span> I have heard of you, that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that light, understanding, and excellent wisdom are found in you.   <span class="verse">15</span> Now the wise men, the enchanters, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known to me its interpretation; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing.   <span class="verse">16</span> But I have heard of you, that you can give interpretations, and dissolve doubts. Now if you can read the writing, and make known to me its interpretation, you shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold around your neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.”  <span class="verse">17</span> Then Daniel answered before the king, “Let your gifts be to yourself, and give your rewards to another. Nevertheless, I will read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.  <span class="verse">18</span> “You, king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty.   <span class="verse">19</span> Because of the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him. He killed whom he wanted to, and he kept alive whom he wanted to. He raised up whom he wanted to, and he put down whom he wanted to.   <span class="verse">20</span> But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.   <span class="verse">21</span> He was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the animals’, and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys. He was fed with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of the sky; until he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men, and that he sets up over it whomever he will.  <span class="verse">22</span> “You, his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this,   <span class="verse">23</span> but have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine from them. You have praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which don’t see, or hear, or know; and you have not glorified the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways.   <span class="verse">24</span> Then the part of the hand was sent from before him, and this writing was inscribed.  <span class="verse">25</span> “This is the writing that was inscribed: ‘MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.’  <span class="verse">26</span> “This is the interpretation of the thing:  MENE: God has counted your kingdom, and brought it to an end.  <span class="verse">27</span> TEKEL: you are weighed in the balances, and are found wanting.  <span class="verse">28</span> PERES: your kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.”  <span class="verse">29</span> Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.  <span class="verse">30</span> In that night Belshazzar the Chaldean King was slain.   <span class="verse">31</span> Darius the Mede received the kingdom, being about sixty-two years old.   <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred twenty local governors, who should be throughout the whole kingdom;   <span class="verse">2</span> and over them three presidents, of whom Daniel was one; that these local governors might give account to them, and that the king should suffer no loss.   <span class="verse">3</span> Then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the local governors, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.  <span class="verse">4</span> Then the presidents and the local governors sought to find occasion against Daniel as touching the kingdom; but they could find no occasion or fault, because he was faithful. There wasn’t any error or fault found in him.   <span class="verse">5</span> Then these men said, “We won’t find any occasion against this Daniel, unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Then these presidents and local governors assembled together to the king, and said this to him, “King Darius, live forever!   <span class="verse">7</span> All the presidents of the kingdom, the deputies and the local governors, the counselors and the governors, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a strong decree, that whoever asks a petition of any god or man for thirty days, except of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.   <span class="verse">8</span> Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.”   <span class="verse">9</span> Therefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.  <span class="verse">10</span> When Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house (now his windows were open in his room toward Jerusalem) and he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did before.   <span class="verse">11</span> Then these men assembled together, and found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.   <span class="verse">12</span> Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree: “Haven’t you signed a decree that every man who makes a petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions?”  The king answered, “This thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which doesn’t alter.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Then they answered and said before the king, “That Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, doesn’t respect you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.”   <span class="verse">14</span> Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him; and he labored until the going down of the sun to rescue him.  <span class="verse">15</span> Then these men assembled together to the king, and said to the king, “Know, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.”  <span class="verse">17</span> A stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.   <span class="verse">18</span> Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting. No musical instruments were brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.  <span class="verse">19</span> Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.   <span class="verse">20</span> When he came near to the den to Daniel, he cried with a troubled voice. The king spoke and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?”  <span class="verse">21</span> Then Daniel said to the king, “O king, live forever!   <span class="verse">22</span> My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not hurt me; because as before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm.”  <span class="verse">23</span> Then the king was exceedingly glad, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no kind of harm was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.  <span class="verse">24</span> The king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions mauled them, and broke all their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.  <span class="verse">25</span> Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages, who dwell in all the earth:  “Peace be multiplied to you.  <span class="verse">26</span> “I make a decree that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;  “for he is the living God,  and steadfast forever.  His kingdom is that which will not be destroyed.  His dominion will be even to the end.  <span class="verse">27</span> He delivers and rescues.  He works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth,  who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”  <span class="verse">28</span> So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

Let this be your consolation.  <span class="verse">3</span> Allow me, and I also will speak;  After I have spoken, mock on.  <span class="verse">4</span> As for me, is my complaint to man?  Why shouldn’t I be impatient?  <span class="verse">5</span> Look at me, and be astonished.  Lay your hand on your mouth.  <span class="verse">6</span> When I remember, I am troubled.  Horror takes hold of my flesh.  <span class="verse">7</span> “Why do the wicked live,  become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?  <span class="verse">8</span> Their child is established with them in their sight,  their offspring before their eyes.  <span class="verse">9</span> Their houses are safe from fear,  neither is the rod of God upon them.  <span class="verse">10</span> Their bulls breed without fail.  Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry.  <span class="verse">11</span> They send out their little ones like a flock.  Their children dance.  <span class="verse">12</span> They sing to the tambourine and harp,  and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.  <span class="verse">13</span> They spend their days in prosperity.  In an instant they go down to Sheol. <span class="verse">14</span> They tell God, ‘Depart from us,  for we don’t want to know about your ways.  <span class="verse">15</span> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?  What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’  <span class="verse">16</span> Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand.  The counsel of the wicked is far from me.  <span class="verse">17</span> “How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,  that their calamity comes on them,  that God distributes sorrows in his anger?  <span class="verse">18</span> How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind,  as chaff that the storm carries away?  <span class="verse">19</span> You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’  Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.  <span class="verse">20</span> Let his own eyes see his destruction.  Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.  <span class="verse">21</span> For what does he care for his house after him,  when the number of his months is cut off?

He took a towel and wrapped a towel around his waist.   <span class="verse">5</span> Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.   <span class="verse">6</span> Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”  <span class="verse">7</span> Jesus answered him,  “You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.” <span class="verse">8</span> Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!”  Jesus answered him,  “If I don’t wash you, you have no part with me.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”  <span class="verse">10</span> Jesus said to him,  “Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you.”  <span class="verse">11</span> For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said,  “You are not all clean.”
