		<span class="reference">Ezekiel 31-32</span>  <span class="chapter">31</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his multitude:  ‘Whom are you like in your greatness?  <span class="verse">3</span> Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon  with beautiful branches,  and with a forest-like shade,  of high stature;  and its top was among the thick boughs.  <span class="verse">4</span> The waters nourished it.  The deep made it to grow.  Its rivers ran all around its plantation;  and it sent out its channels to all the trees of the field.  <span class="verse">5</span> Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field;  and its boughs were multiplied.  Its branches became long by reason of many waters,  when it spread them out.  <span class="verse">6</span> All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs.  Under its branches, all the animals of the field gave birth to their young.  All great nations lived under its shadow.  <span class="verse">7</span> Thus it was beautiful in its greatness,  in the length of its branches;  for its root was by many waters.  <span class="verse">8</span> The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it.  The cypress trees were not like its boughs.  The pine trees were not as its branches;  nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty.  <span class="verse">9</span> I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches,  so that all the trees of Eden,  that were in the garden of God, envied it.’  <span class="verse">10</span> “Therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh: ‘Because you are exalted in stature, and he has set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;   <span class="verse">11</span> I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations. He will surely deal with him. I have driven him out for his wickedness.   <span class="verse">12</span> Strangers, the tyrants of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him. His branches have fallen on the mountains and in all the valleys and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land. All the peoples of the earth have gone down from his shadow, and have left him.   <span class="verse">13</span> All the birds of the sky will dwell on his ruin, and all the animals of the field will be on his branches;   <span class="verse">14</span> to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, and don’t set their top among the thick boughs. Their mighty ones don’t stand up on their height, even all who drink water; for they are all delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, among the children of men, with those who go down to the pit.’  <span class="verse">15</span> “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘In the day when he went down to Sheol   I caused a mourning. I covered the deep for him, and I restrained its rivers. The great waters were stopped. I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.   <span class="verse">16</span> I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol  with those who descend into the pit. All the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts of the earth.   <span class="verse">17</span> They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, who lived under his shadow in the middle of the nations.  <span class="verse">18</span> “ ‘To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth. You will lie in the middle of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.  “ ‘This is Pharaoh and all his multitude,’ says the Lord Yahweh.”   <span class="chapter">32</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, “Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> ‘Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tell him,  “You were likened to a young lion of the nations;  yet you are as a monster in the seas.  You broke out with your rivers,  and troubled the waters with your feet,  and fouled their rivers.”  <span class="verse">3</span> The Lord Yahweh says:  “I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples;  and they will bring you up in my net.  <span class="verse">4</span> I will leave you on the land.  I will cast you out on the open field,  and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you.  I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you.  <span class="verse">5</span> I will lay your flesh on the mountains,  and fill the valleys with your height.  <span class="verse">6</span> I will also water the land in which you swim with your blood,  even to the mountains.  The watercourses will be full of you.  <span class="verse">7</span> When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens  and make its stars dark.  I will cover the sun with a cloud,  and the moon won’t give its light.  <span class="verse">8</span> I will make all the bright lights of the sky dark over you,  and set darkness on your land,” says the Lord Yahweh.  <span class="verse">9</span> “I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples,  when I bring your destruction among the nations,  into the countries which you have not known.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you,  and their kings will be horribly afraid for you,  when I brandish my sword before them.  They will tremble at every moment,  every man for his own life,  in the day of your fall.”  <span class="verse">11</span> For the Lord Yahweh says:  “The sword of the king of Babylon will come on you.  <span class="verse">12</span> I will cause your multitude to fall by the swords of the mighty.  They are all the ruthless of the nations.  They will bring the pride of Egypt to nothing,  and all its multitude will be destroyed.  <span class="verse">13</span> I will destroy also all its animals from beside many waters.  The foot of man won’t trouble them any more,  nor will the hoofs of animals trouble them.  <span class="verse">14</span> Then I will make their waters clear,  and cause their rivers to run like oil,”  says the Lord Yahweh.  <span class="verse">15</span> “When I make the land of Egypt desolate and waste,  a land destitute of that of which it was full,  when I strike all those who dwell therein,  then they will know that I am Yahweh.  <span class="verse">16</span> “ ‘ “This is the lamentation with which they will lament. The daughters of the nations will lament with this. They will lament with it over Egypt, and over all her multitude,” says the Lord Yahweh.’ ”  <span class="verse">17</span> Also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">18</span> “Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.   <span class="verse">19</span> Whom do you pass in beauty? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.   <span class="verse">20</span> They will fall among those who are slain by the sword. She is delivered to the sword. Draw her away with all her multitudes.   <span class="verse">21</span> The strong among the mighty will speak to him out of the middle of Sheol   with those who help him. They have gone down. The uncircumcised lie still, slain by the sword.  <span class="verse">22</span> “Asshur is there with all her company. Her graves are all around her. All of them slain, fallen by the sword;   <span class="verse">23</span> whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit, and her company is around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.  <span class="verse">24</span> “There is Elam and all her multitude around her grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit.   <span class="verse">25</span> They have set her a bed among the slain with all her multitude. Her graves are around her; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit. He is put among those who are slain.  <span class="verse">26</span> “There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude. Their graves are around them, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.   <span class="verse">27</span> They will not lie with the mighty who are fallen of the uncircumcised, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities are on their bones; for they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.  <span class="verse">28</span> “But you will be broken among the uncircumcised, and will lie with those who are slain by the sword.  <span class="verse">29</span> “There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, who in their might are laid with those who are slain by the sword. They will lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the pit.  <span class="verse">30</span> “There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain. They are put to shame in the terror which they caused by their might. They lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.  <span class="verse">31</span> “Pharaoh will see them, and will be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword,” says the Lord Yahweh.   <span class="verse">32</span> “For I have put his terror in the land of the living. He will be laid among the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude,” says the Lord Yahweh.

I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.  <span class="verse">2</span> I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me.  Show me why you contend with me.  <span class="verse">3</span> Is it good to you that you should oppress,  that you should despise the work of your hands,  and smile on the counsel of the wicked?  <span class="verse">4</span> Do you have eyes of flesh?  Or do you see as man sees?  <span class="verse">5</span> Are your days as the days of mortals,  or your years as man’s years,  <span class="verse">6</span> that you inquire after my iniquity,  and search after my sin?  <span class="verse">7</span> Although you know that I am not wicked,  there is no one who can deliver out of your hand.  <span class="verse">8</span> “ ‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether,  yet you destroy me.  <span class="verse">9</span> Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay.  Will you bring me into dust again?  <span class="verse">10</span> Haven’t you poured me out like milk,  and curdled me like cheese?  <span class="verse">11</span> You have clothed me with skin and flesh,  and knit me together with bones and sinews.  <span class="verse">12</span> You have granted me life and loving kindness.  Your visitation has preserved my spirit.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yet you hid these things in your heart.  I know that this is with you:  <span class="verse">14</span> if I sin, then you mark me.  You will not acquit me from my iniquity.  <span class="verse">15</span> If I am wicked, woe to me.  If I am righteous, I still will not lift up my head,  being filled with disgrace,  and conscious of my affliction.  <span class="verse">16</span> If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion.  Again you show yourself powerful to me.  <span class="verse">17</span> You renew your witnesses against me,  and increase your indignation on me.  Changes and warfare are with me.  <span class="verse">18</span> “ ‘Why, then, have you brought me out of the womb?

If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”  <span class="verse">25</span> Jesus answered them,  “I told you, and you don’t believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, these testify about me.  <span class="verse">26</span> But you don’t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.  <span class="verse">27</span> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.  <span class="verse">28</span> I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.  <span class="verse">29</span> My Father who has given them to me is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s hand.  <span class="verse">30</span> I and the Father are one.” <span class="verse">31</span> Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.   <span class="verse">32</span> Jesus answered them,  “I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?”

		<span class="reference">1 John 3:1-10</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> See how great a love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t know him.   <span class="verse">2</span> Beloved, now we are children of God. It is not yet revealed what we will be; but we know that when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is.   <span class="verse">3</span> Everyone who has this hope set on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.   <span class="verse">4</span> Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness.   <span class="verse">5</span> You know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and no sin is in him.   <span class="verse">6</span> Whoever remains in him doesn’t sin. Whoever sins hasn’t seen him and doesn’t know him.  <span class="verse">7</span> Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.   <span class="verse">8</span> He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of the devil.   <span class="verse">9</span> Whoever is born of God doesn’t commit sin, because his seed remains in him, and he can’t sin, because he is born of God.   <span class="verse">10</span> In this the children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn’t do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn’t love his brother.
