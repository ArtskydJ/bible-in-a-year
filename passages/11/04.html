		<span class="reference">Ezekiel 9-10</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Cause those who are in charge of the city to draw near, each man with his destroying weapon in his hand.”   <span class="verse">2</span> Behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lies toward the north, every man with his slaughter weapon in his hand. One man in the middle of them was clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side. They went in, and stood beside the bronze altar.  <span class="verse">3</span> The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side.   <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh said to him, “Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the abominations that are done within it.”  <span class="verse">5</span> To the others he said in my hearing, “Go through the city after him, and strike. Don’t let your eye spare, neither have pity.   <span class="verse">6</span> Kill utterly the old man, the young man, the virgin, little children and women; but don’t come near any man on whom is the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.”  Then they began at the old men who were before the house.  <span class="verse">7</span> He said to them, “Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out!”  They went out, and struck in the city.   <span class="verse">8</span> While they were killing, and I was left, I fell on my face, and cried, and said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem?”  <span class="verse">9</span> Then he said to me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perversion; for they say, ‘Yahweh has forsaken the land, and Yahweh doesn’t see.’   <span class="verse">10</span> As for me also, my eye won’t spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way on their head.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, “I have done as you have commanded me.”   <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then I looked, and see, in the expanse that was over the head of the cherubim there appeared above them as it were a sapphire  stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.   <span class="verse">2</span> He spoke to the man clothed in linen, and said, “Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fill both your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.”  He went in as I watched.   <span class="verse">3</span> Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.   <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh’s glory mounted up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of Yahweh’s glory.   <span class="verse">5</span> The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.  <span class="verse">6</span> It came to pass, when he commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” that he went in, and stood beside a wheel.   <span class="verse">7</span> The cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of him who was clothed in linen, who took it and went out.   <span class="verse">8</span> The form of a man’s hand appeared here in the cherubim under their wings.  <span class="verse">9</span> I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub, and another wheel beside another cherub. The appearance of the wheels was like a beryl stone.   <span class="verse">10</span> As for their appearance, the four of them had one likeness, like a wheel within a wheel.   <span class="verse">11</span> When they went, they went in their four directions. They didn’t turn as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it. They didn’t turn as they went.   <span class="verse">12</span> Their whole body, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes all around, even the wheels that the four of them had.   <span class="verse">13</span> As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, “the whirling wheels”.   <span class="verse">14</span> Every one them had four faces. The first face was the face of the cherub. The second face was the face of a man. The third face was the face of a lion. The fourth was the face of an eagle.  <span class="verse">15</span> The cherubim mounted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river Chebar.   <span class="verse">16</span> When the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels also didn’t turn from beside them.   <span class="verse">17</span> When they stood, these stood. When they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.  <span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh’s glory went out from over the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.   <span class="verse">19</span> The cherubim lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out, with the wheels beside them. Then they stood at the door of the east gate of Yahweh’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.  <span class="verse">20</span> This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.   <span class="verse">21</span> Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. The likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.   <span class="verse">22</span> As for the likeness of their faces, they were the faces which I saw by the river Chebar, their appearances and themselves. They each went straight forward.

Don’t let God from above seek for it,  neither let the light shine on it.  <span class="verse">5</span> Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own.  Let a cloud dwell on it.  Let all that makes black the day terrify it.  <span class="verse">6</span> As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it.  Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.  Let it not come into the number of the months.  <span class="verse">7</span> Behold, let that night be barren.  Let no joyful voice come therein.  <span class="verse">8</span> Let them curse it who curse the day,  who are ready to rouse up leviathan.  <span class="verse">9</span> Let the stars of its twilight be dark.  Let it look for light, but have none,  neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,  <span class="verse">10</span> because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb,  nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.  <span class="verse">11</span> “Why didn’t I die from the womb?  Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?  <span class="verse">12</span> Why did the knees receive me?  Or why the breast, that I should nurse?  <span class="verse">13</span> For now should I have lain down and been quiet.  I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,  <span class="verse">14</span> with kings and counselors of the earth,  who built up waste places for themselves;  <span class="verse">15</span> or with princes who had gold,  who filled their houses with silver:  <span class="verse">16</span> or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,  as infants who never saw light.  <span class="verse">17</span> There the wicked cease from troubling.  There the weary are at rest.  <span class="verse">18</span> There the prisoners are at ease together.  They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.  <span class="verse">19</span> The small and the great are there.  The servant is free from his master.  <span class="verse">20</span> “Why is light given to him who is in misery,  life to the bitter in soul,  <span class="verse">21</span> Who long for death, but it doesn’t come;  and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,  <span class="verse">22</span> who rejoice exceedingly,  and are glad, when they can find the grave?  <span class="verse">23</span> Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,  whom God has hedged in?  <span class="verse">24</span> For my sighing comes before I eat.  My groanings are poured out like water.  <span class="verse">25</span> For the thing which I fear comes on me,  That which I am afraid of comes to me.  <span class="verse">26</span> I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest;  but trouble comes.”

I judge no one.  <span class="verse">16</span> Even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.  <span class="verse">17</span> It’s also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid. <span class="verse">18</span> I am one who testifies about myself, and the Father who sent me testifies about me.” <span class="verse">19</span> They said therefore to him, “Where is your Father?”  Jesus answered,  “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.” <span class="verse">20</span> Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.
