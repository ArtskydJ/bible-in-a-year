Your builders have perfected your beauty.  <span class="verse">5</span> They have made all your planks of cypress trees from Senir.  They have taken a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.  <span class="verse">6</span> They have made your oars of the oaks of Bashan.  They have made your benches of ivory inlaid in cypress wood from the islands of Kittim.  <span class="verse">7</span> Your sail was of fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt,  that it might be to you for a banner.  Blue and purple from the islands of Elishah was your awning.  <span class="verse">8</span> The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were your rowers.  Your wise men, Tyre, were in you.  They were your pilots.  <span class="verse">9</span> The old men of Gebal  and its wise men were your repairers of ship seams in you.  All the ships of the sea with their mariners were in you  to deal in your merchandise.  <span class="verse">10</span> “ ‘ “Persia, Lud, and Put were in your army,  your men of war.

They traded for your wares with emeralds, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies.  <span class="verse">17</span> “ ‘ “Judah and the land of Israel were your traders. They traded wheat of Minnith, confections, honey, oil, and balm for your merchandise.  <span class="verse">18</span> “ ‘ “Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your handiworks, by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches, with the wine of Helbon, and white wool.  <span class="verse">19</span> “ ‘ “Vedan and Javan traded with yarn for your wares: bright iron, cassia, and calamus were among your merchandise.  <span class="verse">20</span> “ ‘ “Dedan was your trafficker in precious cloths for riding.  <span class="verse">21</span> “ ‘ “Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar were the merchants of your hand; in lambs, rams, and goats.

They traded for your wares with the chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.  <span class="verse">23</span> “ ‘ “Haran, Canneh, and Eden, the traders of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad, were your traders.   <span class="verse">24</span> These were your traders in choice wares, in wrappings of blue and embroidered work, and in chests of rich clothing, bound with cords and made of cedar, among your merchandise.  <span class="verse">25</span> “ ‘ “The ships of Tarshish were your caravans for your merchandise.  You were replenished  and made very glorious in the heart of the seas.  <span class="verse">26</span> Your rowers have brought you into great waters.  The east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas.  <span class="verse">27</span> Your riches,  your wares,  your merchandise,  your mariners,  your pilots,  your repairers of ship seams,  the dealers in your merchandise,  and all your men of war, who are in you,  with all your company which is among you,  will fall into the heart of the seas in the day of your ruin.  <span class="verse">28</span> At the sound of the cry of your pilots,  the pasture lands will shake.  <span class="verse">29</span> All who handle the oars,  the mariners and all the pilots of the sea,  will come down from their ships.  They will stand on the land,  <span class="verse">30</span> and will cause their voice to be heard over you,  and will cry bitterly.  They will cast up dust on their heads.  They will wallow in the ashes.  <span class="verse">31</span> They will make themselves bald for you,  and clothe themselves with sackcloth.  They will weep for you in bitterness of soul,  with bitter mourning.  <span class="verse">32</span> In their wailing they will take up a lamentation for you,  and lament over you, saying,  ‘Who is there like Tyre,  like her who is brought to silence in the middle of the sea?’  <span class="verse">33</span> When your wares went out of the seas,  you filled many peoples.  You enriched the kings of the earth  with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.  <span class="verse">34</span> In the time that you were broken by the seas,  in the depths of the waters,  your merchandise  and all your company fell within you.  <span class="verse">35</span> All the inhabitants of the islands are astonished at you,  and their kings are horribly afraid.  They are troubled in their face.  <span class="verse">36</span> The merchants among the peoples hiss at you.  You have become a terror,  and you will be no more.” ’ ”   <span class="chapter">28</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word came again to me, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Son of man, tell the prince of Tyre, ‘The Lord Yahweh says:  “Because your heart is lifted up,  and you have said, ‘I am a god,  I sit in the seat of God,  in the middle of the seas;’  yet you are man,  and not God,  though you set your heart as the heart of God—  <span class="verse">3</span> behold, you are wiser than Daniel;  there is no secret that is hidden from you;  <span class="verse">4</span> by your wisdom and by your understanding you have gotten yourself riches,  and have gotten gold and silver into your treasures;  <span class="verse">5</span> by your great wisdom  and by your trading you have increased your riches,  and your heart is lifted up because of your riches—”  <span class="verse">6</span> “ ‘therefore the Lord Yahweh says:  “Because you have set your heart as the heart of God,  <span class="verse">7</span> therefore, behold, I will bring strangers on you,  the terrible of the nations.  They will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom.  They will defile your brightness.  <span class="verse">8</span> They will bring you down to the pit.  You will die the death of those who are slain  in the heart of the seas.  <span class="verse">9</span> Will you yet say before him who kills you, ‘I am God’?  But you are man, and not God,  in the hand of him who wounds you.  <span class="verse">10</span> You will die the death of the uncircumcised  by the hand of strangers;  for I have spoken it,” says the Lord Yahweh.’ ”  <span class="verse">11</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">12</span> “Son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and tell him, ‘The Lord Yahweh says:  “You were the seal of full measure,  full of wisdom,  and perfect in beauty.  <span class="verse">13</span> You were in Eden,  the garden of God.  Every precious stone adorned you:  ruby, topaz, emerald,  chrysolite, onyx, jasper,  sapphire,  turquoise, and beryl.  Gold work of tambourines  and of pipes was in you.  They were prepared in the day that you were created.  <span class="verse">14</span> You were the anointed cherub who covers.  Then I set you up on the holy mountain of God.  You have walked up and down in the middle of the stones of fire.  <span class="verse">15</span> You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created,  until unrighteousness was found in you.  <span class="verse">16</span> By the abundance of your commerce, your insides were filled with violence,  and you have sinned.  Therefore I have cast you as profane out of God’s mountain.  I have destroyed you, covering cherub,  from the middle of the stones of fire.  <span class="verse">17</span> Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty.  You have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor.  I have cast you to the ground.  I have laid you before kings,  that they may see you.  <span class="verse">18</span> By the multitude of your iniquities,  in the unrighteousness of your commerce,  you have profaned your sanctuaries.  Therefore I have brought out a fire from the middle of you.  It has devoured you.  I have turned you to ashes on the earth  in the sight of all those who see you.  <span class="verse">19</span> All those who know you among the peoples will be astonished at you.  You have become a terror,  and you will exist no more.” ’ ”  <span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">21</span> “Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against it,   <span class="verse">22</span> and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says:  “Behold, I am against you, Sidon.  I will be glorified among you.  Then they will know that I am Yahweh,  when I have executed judgments in her,  and am sanctified in her.  <span class="verse">23</span> For I will send pestilence into her,  and blood into her streets.  The wounded will fall within her,  with the sword on her on every side.  Then they will know that I am Yahweh.  <span class="verse">24</span> “ ‘ “There will be no more a pricking brier to the house of Israel, nor a hurting thorn of any that are around them that scorned them. Then they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">25</span> “ ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and am sanctified in them in the sight of the nations, then they will dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob.   <span class="verse">26</span> They will dwell in it securely. Yes, they will build houses, plant vineyards, and will dwell securely, when I have executed judgments on all those who scorn them all around. Then they will know that I am Yahweh their God.” ’ ”

Its pillars tremble.  <span class="verse">7</span> He commands the sun and it doesn’t rise,  and seals up the stars.  <span class="verse">8</span> He alone stretches out the heavens,  and treads on the waves of the sea.  <span class="verse">9</span> He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,  and the rooms of the south.  <span class="verse">10</span> He does great things past finding out;  yes, marvelous things without number.  <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him.  He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him.  <span class="verse">12</span> Behold, he snatches away.  Who can hinder him?  Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’  <span class="verse">13</span> “God will not withdraw his anger.  The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.  <span class="verse">14</span> How much less will I answer him,  And choose my words to argue with him?  <span class="verse">15</span> Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him.  I would make supplication to my judge.  <span class="verse">16</span> If I had called, and he had answered me,  yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.  <span class="verse">17</span> For he breaks me with a storm,  and multiplies my wounds without cause.  <span class="verse">18</span> He will not allow me to catch my breath,  but fills me with bitterness.  <span class="verse">19</span> If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!  If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’  <span class="verse">20</span> Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me.  Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse.
