		<span class="reference">Ezekiel 4-6</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> “You also, son of man, take a tile, and lay it before yourself, and portray on it a city, even Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">2</span> Lay siege against it, build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it and plant battering rams against it all around.   <span class="verse">3</span> Take for yourself an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city. Then set your face toward it. It will be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Moreover lie on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it. According to the number of the days that you shall lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.   <span class="verse">5</span> For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be to you a number of days, even three hundred ninety days. So you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.  <span class="verse">6</span> “Again, when you have accomplished these, you shall lie on your right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have appointed forty days, each day for a year, to you.   <span class="verse">7</span> You shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm uncovered; and you shall prophesy against it.   <span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I put ropes on you, and you shall not turn yourself from one side to the other, until you have accomplished the days of your siege.  <span class="verse">9</span> “Take for yourself also wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel. Make bread of it. According to the number of the days that you will lie on your side, even three hundred ninety days, you shall eat of it.   <span class="verse">10</span> Your food which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels  a day. From time to time you shall eat it.   <span class="verse">11</span> You shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin.  From time to time you shall drink.   <span class="verse">12</span> You shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.”   <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh said, “Even thus will the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations where I will drive them.”  <span class="verse">14</span> Then I said, “Ah Lord Yahweh! Behold, my soul has not been polluted; for from my youth up even until now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of animals. No abominable meat has come into my mouth!”  <span class="verse">15</span> Then he said to me, “Behold, I have given you cow’s dung for man’s dung, and you shall prepare your bread on it.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Moreover he said to me, “Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They will eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness. They will drink water by measure, and in dismay;   <span class="verse">17</span> that they may lack bread and water, be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.   <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> “You, son of man, take a sharp sword. You shall take it as a barber’s razor to yourself, and shall cause it to pass over your head and over your beard. Then take balances to weigh and divide the hair.   <span class="verse">2</span> A third part you shall burn in the fire in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled. You shall take a third part, and strike with the sword around it. A third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will draw out a sword after them.   <span class="verse">3</span> You shall take of it a few in number, and bind them in the folds of your robe.   <span class="verse">4</span> Of these again you shall take, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From it a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.  <span class="verse">5</span> “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the middle of the nations, and countries are around her.   <span class="verse">6</span> She has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her; for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have not walked in them.’  <span class="verse">7</span> “Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my ordinances, neither have followed the ordinances of the nations that are around you;   <span class="verse">8</span> therefore the Lord Yahweh says: ‘Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments among you in the sight of the nations.   <span class="verse">9</span> I will do in you that which I have not done, and which I will not do anything like it any more, because of all your abominations.   <span class="verse">10</span> Therefore the fathers will eat the sons within you, and the sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments on you; and I will scatter the whole remnant of you to all the winds.   <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore as I live,’ says the Lord Yahweh, ‘surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you. My eye won’t spare, and I will have no pity.   <span class="verse">12</span> A third part of you will die with the pestilence, and they will be consumed with famine within you. A third part will fall by the sword around you. A third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will draw out a sword after them.  <span class="verse">13</span> “ ‘Thus my anger will be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I will be comforted. They will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath on them.  <span class="verse">14</span> “ ‘Moreover I will make you a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are around you, in the sight of all that pass by.   <span class="verse">15</span> So it will be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment, to the nations that are around you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes—I, Yahweh, have spoken it—   <span class="verse">16</span> when I send on them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread.   <span class="verse">17</span> I will send on you famine and evil animals, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood will pass through you. I will bring the sword on you. I, Yahweh, have spoken it.’ ”   <span class="chapter">6</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them,   <span class="verse">3</span> and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.   <span class="verse">4</span> Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your idols.   <span class="verse">5</span> I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars.   <span class="verse">6</span> In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.   <span class="verse">7</span> The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am Yahweh.  <span class="verse">8</span> “ ‘ “Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries.   <span class="verse">9</span> Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.   <span class="verse">10</span> They will know that I am Yahweh. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.” ’  <span class="verse">11</span> “The Lord Yahweh says: ‘Strike with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, “Alas!” Because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they will fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.   <span class="verse">12</span> He who is far off will die of the pestilence. He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them.   <span class="verse">13</span> You will know that I am Yahweh, when their slain men are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the places where they offered pleasant aroma to all their idols.   <span class="verse">14</span> I will stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations. Then they will know that I am Yahweh.’ ”

Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”  <span class="verse">16</span> While he was still speaking, there also came another, and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”  <span class="verse">17</span> While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”  <span class="verse">18</span> While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,   <span class="verse">19</span> and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”  <span class="verse">20</span> Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped.   <span class="verse">21</span> He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.”   <span class="verse">22</span> In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing.
