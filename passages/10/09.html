		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 18-20</span>  <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Then I went down to the potter’s house, and behold, he was making something on the wheels.   <span class="verse">4</span> When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.  <span class="verse">5</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">6</span> “House of Israel, can’t I do with you as this potter?” says Yahweh. “Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, house of Israel.   <span class="verse">7</span> At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;   <span class="verse">8</span> if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.   <span class="verse">9</span> At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;   <span class="verse">10</span> if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good with which I said I would benefit them.  <span class="verse">11</span> “Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a plan against you. Everyone return from his evil way now, and amend your ways and your doings.” ’   <span class="verse">12</span> But they say, ‘It is in vain; for we will walk after our own plans, and we will each follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.’ ”  <span class="verse">13</span> Therefore Yahweh says:  “Ask now among the nations,  ‘Who has heard such things?’  The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.  <span class="verse">14</span> Will the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field?  Will the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?  <span class="verse">15</span> For my people have forgotten me.  They have burned incense to false gods.  They have been made to stumble in their ways,  in the ancient paths,  to walk in byways, in a way not built up,  <span class="verse">16</span> to make their land an astonishment,  and a perpetual hissing.  Everyone who passes by it will be astonished,  and shake his head.  <span class="verse">17</span> I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy.  I will show them the back, and not the face,  in the day of their calamity.  <span class="verse">18</span> Then they said, “Come! Let’s devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law won’t perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let’s strike him with the tongue, and let’s not give heed to any of his words.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Give heed to me, Yahweh,  and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.  <span class="verse">20</span> Should evil be recompensed for good?  For they have dug a pit for my soul.  Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them,  to turn away your wrath from them.  <span class="verse">21</span> Therefore deliver up their children to the famine,  and give them over to the power of the sword.  Let their wives become childless and widows.  Let their men be killed  and their young men struck by the sword in battle.  <span class="verse">22</span> Let a cry be heard from their houses  when you bring a troop suddenly on them;  for they have dug a pit to take me  and hidden snares for my feet.  <span class="verse">23</span> Yet, Yahweh, you know all their counsel against me to kill me.  Don’t forgive their iniquity.  Don’t blot out their sin from your sight,  Let them be overthrown before you.  Deal with them in the time of your anger.   <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">1</span> Thus said Yahweh, “Go, and buy a potter’s earthen container, and take some of the elders of the people, and of the elders of the priests;   <span class="verse">2</span> and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the gate Harsith, and proclaim there the words that I will tell you.   <span class="verse">3</span> Say, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “Behold, I will bring evil on this place, which whoever hears, his ears will tingle.   <span class="verse">4</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have defiled this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods that they didn’t know, they, their fathers, and the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,   <span class="verse">5</span> and have built the high places of Baal, to burn their children in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I didn’t command, nor speak, which didn’t even enter into my mind.   <span class="verse">6</span> Therefore, behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that this place will no more be called ‘Topheth’, nor ‘The Valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’.  <span class="verse">7</span> “ ‘ “I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place. I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.   <span class="verse">8</span> I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing. Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.   <span class="verse">9</span> I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters. They will each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies, and those who seek their life, will distress them.” ’  <span class="verse">10</span> “Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with you,   <span class="verse">11</span> and shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, that can’t be made whole again. They will bury in Topheth, until there is no place to bury.   <span class="verse">12</span> This is what I will do to this place,” says Yahweh, “and to its inhabitants, even making this city as Topheth.   <span class="verse">13</span> The houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, which are defiled, will be as the place of Topheth, even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.” ’ ”  <span class="verse">14</span> Then Jeremiah came from Topheth, where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of Yahweh’s house, and said to all the people:   <span class="verse">15</span> “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, ‘Behold, I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have made their neck stiff, that they may not hear my words.’ ”   <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in Yahweh’s house, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.   <span class="verse">2</span> Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">3</span> On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib. <span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will see it. I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon, and will kill them with the sword.   <span class="verse">5</span> Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, I will give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. They will make them captives, take them, and carry them to Babylon.   <span class="verse">6</span> You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity. You will come to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.’ ”  <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded.  You are stronger than I, and have prevailed.  I have become a laughingstock all day.  Everyone mocks me.  <span class="verse">8</span> For as often as I speak, I cry out;  I cry, “Violence and destruction!”  because Yahweh’s word has been made a reproach to me,  and a derision, all day.  <span class="verse">9</span> If I say, I will not make mention of him,  or speak any more in his name,  then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones.  I am weary with holding it in.  I can’t.  <span class="verse">10</span> For I have heard the defaming of many,  “Terror on every side!  Denounce, and we will denounce him!”  say all my familiar friends,  those who watch for my fall.  “Perhaps he will be persuaded,  and we will prevail against him,  and we will take our revenge on him.”  <span class="verse">11</span> But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one.  Therefore my persecutors will stumble,  and they won’t prevail.  They will be utterly disappointed,  because they have not dealt wisely,  even with an everlasting dishonor which will never be forgotten.  <span class="verse">12</span> But Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous,  who sees the heart and the mind,  let me see your vengeance on them,  for I have revealed my cause to you.  <span class="verse">13</span> Sing to Yahweh!  Praise Yahweh,  for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.  <span class="verse">14</span> Cursed is the day in which I was born.  Don’t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.  <span class="verse">15</span> Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying,  “A boy is born to you,” making him very glad.  <span class="verse">16</span> Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew,  and didn’t repent.  Let him hear a cry in the morning,  and shouting at noontime;  <span class="verse">17</span> because he didn’t kill me from the womb.  So my mother would have been my grave,  and her womb always great.  <span class="verse">18</span> Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow,  that my days should be consumed with shame?

The king profits from the field.  <span class="verse">10</span> He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.   <span class="verse">11</span> When goods increase, those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to its owner, except to feast on them with his eyes?  <span class="verse">12</span> The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not allow him to sleep.  <span class="verse">13</span> There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.   <span class="verse">14</span> Those riches perish by misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand.   <span class="verse">15</span> As he came out of his mother’s womb, naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.   <span class="verse">16</span> This also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who labors for the wind?   <span class="verse">17</span> All his days he also eats in darkness, he is frustrated, and has sickness and wrath.  <span class="verse">18</span> Behold, that which I have seen to be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him; for this is his portion.   <span class="verse">19</span> Every man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God.   <span class="verse">20</span> For he shall not often reflect on the days of his life; because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.

Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?”  <span class="verse">5</span> Jesus answered,  “Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and spirit, he can’t enter into God’s Kingdom. <span class="verse">6</span> That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.  <span class="verse">7</span> Don’t marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’  <span class="verse">8</span> The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” <span class="verse">9</span> Nicodemus answered him, “How can these things be?”  <span class="verse">10</span> Jesus answered him,  “Are you the teacher of Israel, and don’t understand these things?  <span class="verse">11</span> Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you don’t receive our witness.  <span class="verse">12</span> If I told you earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?  <span class="verse">13</span> No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.  <span class="verse">14</span> As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,  <span class="verse">15</span> that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
