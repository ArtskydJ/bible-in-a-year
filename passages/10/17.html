		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 35-36</span>  <span class="chapter">35</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into Yahweh’s house, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, with his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;   <span class="verse">4</span> and I brought them into Yahweh’s house, into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the room of the princes, which was above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.   <span class="verse">5</span> I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!”  <span class="verse">6</span> But they said, “We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons, forever.   <span class="verse">7</span> You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land in which you live as nomads.’   <span class="verse">8</span> We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters;   <span class="verse">9</span> and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard, field, or seed;   <span class="verse">10</span> but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.   <span class="verse">11</span> But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said, ‘Come! Let’s go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’ ”  <span class="verse">12</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse">13</span> “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words?” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">14</span> “The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment; but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and you have not listened to me.   <span class="verse">15</span> I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way, amend your doings, and don’t go after other gods to serve them, then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers:’ but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me.   <span class="verse">16</span> The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me.” ’  <span class="verse">17</span> “Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.’ ”  <span class="verse">18</span> Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you;’   <span class="verse">19</span> therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jonadab the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before me forever.’ ”   <span class="chapter">36</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Take a scroll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.   <span class="verse">3</span> It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them; that they may each return from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh’s words, which he had spoken to him, on a scroll of a book.   <span class="verse">5</span> Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted. I can’t go into Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">6</span> Therefore you go, and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth, Yahweh’s words, in the ears of the people in Yahweh’s house on the fast day. Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.   <span class="verse">7</span> It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh, and will each return from his evil way; for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book Yahweh’s words in Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">9</span> Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem, proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.   <span class="verse">10</span> Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh’s house, in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan, the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh’s house, in the ears of all the people.  <span class="verse">11</span> When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all Yahweh’s words,   <span class="verse">12</span> he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s room: and behold, all the princes were sitting there, Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.   <span class="verse">13</span> Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.   <span class="verse">14</span> Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people, and come.”  So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.   <span class="verse">15</span> They said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.”  So Baruch read it in their hearing.  <span class="verse">16</span> Now when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.”   <span class="verse">17</span> They asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words at his mouth?”  <span class="verse">18</span> Then Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Then the princes said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah go hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”  <span class="verse">20</span> They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe. Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king.   <span class="verse">21</span> So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king, and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king.   <span class="verse">22</span> Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month; and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.   <span class="verse">23</span> When Jehudi had read three or four leaves, the king cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.   <span class="verse">24</span> The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, and didn’t tear their garments.   <span class="verse">25</span> Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them.   <span class="verse">26</span> The king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.  <span class="verse">27</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, after the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse">28</span> “Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.   <span class="verse">29</span> Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Yahweh says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written therein, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cause to cease from there man and animal?’ ” ’   <span class="verse">30</span> Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He will have no one to sit on David’s throne. His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.   <span class="verse">31</span> I will punish him, his offspring, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn’t listen.” ’ ”  <span class="verse">32</span> Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.

		<span class="reference">John 5:16-23</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">16</span> For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.   <span class="verse">17</span> But Jesus answered them,  “My Father is still working, so I am working, too.” <span class="verse">18</span> For this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.   <span class="verse">19</span> Jesus therefore answered them,  “Most certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also does likewise.  <span class="verse">20</span> For the Father has affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.  <span class="verse">21</span> For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.  <span class="verse">22</span> For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son,  <span class="verse">23</span> that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.

		<span class="reference">1 Peter 1:10-16</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">10</span> Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently. They prophesied of the grace that would come to you,   <span class="verse">11</span> searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that would follow them.   <span class="verse">12</span> To them it was revealed, that they served not to themselves, but to you, in these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.  <span class="verse">13</span> Therefore prepare your minds for action.  Be sober, and set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ—   <span class="verse">14</span> as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,   <span class="verse">15</span> but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;   <span class="verse">16</span> because it is written, “You shall be holy; for I am holy.”
