		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 30-31</span>  <span class="chapter">30</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.   <span class="verse">3</span> For, behold, the days come,’ says Yahweh, ‘that I will reverse the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they will possess it.’ ”  <span class="verse">4</span> These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.   <span class="verse">5</span> For Yahweh says:  “We have heard a voice of trembling;  a voice of fear, and not of peace.  <span class="verse">6</span> Ask now, and see whether a man travails with child.  Why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail,  and all faces are turned pale?  <span class="verse">7</span> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it.  It is even the time of Jacob’s trouble;  but he will be saved out of it.  <span class="verse">8</span> It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will break his yoke from off your neck,  and will burst your bonds.  Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;  <span class="verse">9</span> but they will serve Yahweh their God,  and David their king,  whom I will raise up to them.  <span class="verse">10</span> Therefore don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh.  Don’t be dismayed, Israel.  For, behold, I will save you from afar,  and save your offspring from the land of their captivity.  Jacob will return,  and will be quiet and at ease.  No one will make him afraid.  <span class="verse">11</span> For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you;  for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,  but I will not make a full end of you;  but I will correct you in measure,  and will in no way leave you unpunished.”  <span class="verse">12</span> For Yahweh says,  “Your hurt is incurable.  Your wound is grievous.  <span class="verse">13</span> There is no one to plead your cause,  that you may be bound up.  You have no healing medicines.  <span class="verse">14</span> All your lovers have forgotten you.  They don’t seek you.  For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,  with the chastisement of a cruel one,  for the greatness of your iniquity,  because your sins were increased.  <span class="verse">15</span> Why do you cry over your injury?  Your pain is incurable.  For the greatness of your iniquity,  because your sins have increased,  I have done these things to you.  <span class="verse">16</span> Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured.  All your adversaries, everyone of them, will go into captivity.  Those who plunder you will be plunder.  I will make all who prey on you become prey.  <span class="verse">17</span> For I will restore health to you,  and I will heal you of your wounds,” says Yahweh;  “because they have called you an outcast,  saying, ‘It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.’ ”  <span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh says:  “Behold, I will reverse the captivity of Jacob’s tents,  and have compassion on his dwelling places.  The city will be built on its own hill,  and the palace will be inhabited in its own place.  <span class="verse">19</span> Thanksgiving will proceed out of them  with the voice of those who make merry.  I will multiply them,  and they will not be few;  I will also glorify them,  and they will not be small.  <span class="verse">20</span> Their children also will be as before,  and their congregation will be established before me.  I will punish all who oppress them.  <span class="verse">21</span> Their prince will be one of them,  and their ruler will proceed from among them.  I will cause him to draw near,  and he will approach me;  for who is he who has had boldness to approach me?” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">22</span> “You shall be my people,  and I will be your God.  <span class="verse">23</span> Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out,  a sweeping storm:  it will burst on the head of the wicked.  <span class="verse">24</span> The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return until he has accomplished,  and until he has performed the intentions of his heart.  In the latter days you will understand it.”   <span class="chapter">31</span><span class="verse">1</span> “At that time,” says Yahweh, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people.”  <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh says, “The people who survive the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh appeared of old to me, saying,  “Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love.  Therefore I have drawn you with loving kindness.  <span class="verse">4</span> I will build you again,  and you will be built, O virgin of Israel.  You will again be adorned with your tambourines,  and will go out in the dances of those who make merry.  <span class="verse">5</span> Again you will plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria.  The planters will plant,  and will enjoy its fruit.  <span class="verse">6</span> For there will be a day that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim cry,  ‘Arise! Let’s go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.’ ”  <span class="verse">7</span> For Yahweh says,  “Sing with gladness for Jacob,  and shout for the chief of the nations.  Publish, praise, and say,  ‘Yahweh, save your people,  the remnant of Israel!’  <span class="verse">8</span> Behold, I will bring them from the north country,  and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth,  along with the blind and the lame,  the woman with child and her who travails with child together.  They will return as a great company.  <span class="verse">9</span> They will come with weeping.  I will lead them with petitions.  I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters,  in a straight way in which they won’t stumble;  for I am a father to Israel.  Ephraim is my firstborn.  <span class="verse">10</span> “Hear Yahweh’s word, you nations,  and declare it in the distant islands. Say,  ‘He who scattered Israel will gather him,  and keep him, as a shepherd does his flock.’  <span class="verse">11</span> For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob,  and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.  <span class="verse">12</span> They will come and sing in the height of Zion,  and will flow to the goodness of Yahweh,  to the grain, to the new wine, to the oil,  and to the young of the flock and of the herd.  Their soul will be as a watered garden.  They will not sorrow any more at all.  <span class="verse">13</span> Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance;  the young men and the old together;  for I will turn their mourning into joy,  and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.  <span class="verse">14</span> I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,  and my people will be satisfied with my goodness,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh says:  “A voice is heard in Ramah,  lamentation and bitter weeping,  Rachel weeping for her children.  She refuses to be comforted for her children,  because they are no more.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh says:  “Refrain your voice from weeping,  and your eyes from tears;  for your work will be rewarded,” says Yahweh.  “They will come again from the land of the enemy.  <span class="verse">17</span> There is hope for your latter end,” says Yahweh.  “Your children will come again to their own territory.  <span class="verse">18</span> “I have surely heard Ephraim grieving thus,  ‘You have chastised me,  and I was chastised, as an untrained calf.  Turn me, and I will be turned;  for you are Yahweh my God.  <span class="verse">19</span> Surely after that I was turned.  I repented.  After that I was instructed.  I struck my thigh.  I was ashamed, yes, even confounded,  because I bore the reproach of my youth.’  <span class="verse">20</span> Is Ephraim my dear son?  Is he a darling child?  For as often as I speak against him,  I still earnestly remember him.  therefore my heart yearns for him.  I will surely have mercy on him,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">21</span> “Set up road signs.  Make guideposts.  Set your heart toward the highway,  even the way by which you went.  Turn again, virgin of Israel.  Turn again to these your cities.  <span class="verse">22</span> How long will you go here and there,  you backsliding daughter?  For Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth:  a woman will encompass a man.”  <span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Yet again they will use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I reverse their captivity: ‘Yahweh bless you, habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.’   <span class="verse">24</span> Judah and all its cities will dwell therein together, the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.   <span class="verse">25</span> For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.”  <span class="verse">26</span> On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.  <span class="verse">27</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of animal.   <span class="verse">28</span> It will happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">29</span> “In those days they will say no more,  “ ‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,  and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’  <span class="verse">30</span> But everyone will die for his own iniquity. Every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge.  <span class="verse">31</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,  “that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel,  and with the house of Judah:  <span class="verse">32</span> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;  which covenant of mine they broke,  although I was a husband to them,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">33</span> “But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,”  says Yahweh:  “I will put my law in their inward parts,  and I will write it in their heart.  I will be their God,  and they shall be my people.  <span class="verse">34</span> They will no longer each teach his neighbor,  and every man teach his brother, saying, ‘Know Yahweh;’  for they will all know me,  from their least to their greatest,” says Yahweh:  “for I will forgive their iniquity,  and I will remember their sin no more.”  <span class="verse">35</span> Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day,  and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,  who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar;  Yahweh of Armies is his name, says:  <span class="verse">36</span> “If these ordinances depart from before me,” says Yahweh,  “then the offspring of Israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever.”  <span class="verse">37</span> Yahweh says: “If heaven above can be measured,  and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,  then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">38</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that the city will be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.   <span class="verse">39</span> The measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and will turn toward Goah.   <span class="verse">40</span> The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, will be holy to Yahweh. It will not be plucked up or thrown down any more forever.”

		<span class="reference">Ecclesiastes 8:10-17</span>  <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">10</span> So I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where they did this. This also is vanity.   <span class="verse">11</span> Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.   <span class="verse">12</span> Though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him.   <span class="verse">13</span> But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow, because he doesn’t fear God.  <span class="verse">14</span> There is a vanity which is done on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.   <span class="verse">15</span> Then I commended mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun.  <span class="verse">16</span> When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (even though eyes see no sleep day or night),   <span class="verse">17</span> then I saw all the work of God, that man can’t find out the work that is done under the sun, because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he won’t find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it, he won’t be able to find it.

Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.” <span class="verse">39</span> From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who testified, “He told me everything that I did.”   <span class="verse">40</span> So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days.   <span class="verse">41</span> Many more believed because of his word.   <span class="verse">42</span> They said to the woman, “Now we believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.”

Let him sing praises.   <span class="verse">14</span> Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord,   <span class="verse">15</span> and the prayer of faith will heal him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. If he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.   <span class="verse">16</span> Confess your offenses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The insistent prayer of a righteous person is powerfully effective.   <span class="verse">17</span> Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didn’t rain on the earth for three years and six months.   <span class="verse">18</span> He prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.  <span class="verse">19</span> Brothers, if any among you wanders from the truth and someone turns him back,   <span class="verse">20</span> let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
