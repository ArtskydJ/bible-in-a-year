		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 1-2</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin.   <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh’s  word came to him in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.   <span class="verse">3</span> It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.   <span class="verse">4</span> Now Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,  <span class="verse">5</span> “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.  Before you were born, I sanctified you.  I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Then I said, “Ah, Lord  Yahweh! Behold,  I don’t know how to speak; for I am a child.”  <span class="verse">7</span> But Yahweh said to me, “Don’t say, ‘I am a child;’ for you must go to whomever I send you, and you must say whatever I command you.   <span class="verse">8</span> Don’t be afraid because of them, for I am with you to rescue you,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">9</span> Then Yahweh stretched out his hand, and touched my mouth. Then Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.   <span class="verse">10</span> Behold, I have today set you over the nations and over the kingdoms, to uproot and to tear down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”  I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Then Yahweh said to me, “You have seen well; for I watch over my word to perform it.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?”  I said, “I see a boiling cauldron; and it is tipping away from the north.”  <span class="verse">14</span> Then Yahweh said to me, “Out of the north, evil will break out on all the inhabitants of the land.   <span class="verse">15</span> For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says Yahweh.  “They will come, and they will each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,  and against all its walls all around, and against all the cities of Judah.  <span class="verse">16</span> I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness,  in that they have forsaken me,  and have burned incense to other gods,  and worshiped the works of their own hands.  <span class="verse">17</span> “You therefore put your belt on your waist, arise, and say to them all that I command you. Don’t be dismayed at them, lest I dismay you before them.   <span class="verse">18</span> For, behold, I have made you today a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.   <span class="verse">19</span> They will fight against you, but they will not prevail against you; for I am with you”, says Yahweh, “to rescue you.”   <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says,  “I remember for you the kindness of your youth,  the love of your weddings;  how you went after me in the wilderness,  in a land that was not sown.  <span class="verse">3</span> Israel was holiness to Yahweh,  the first fruits of his increase.  All who devour him will be held guilty.  Evil will come on them,” ’ says Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Hear Yahweh’s word, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel!   <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh says,  “What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,  that they have gone far from me,  and have walked after worthless vanity,  and have become worthless?  <span class="verse">6</span> They didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,  who led us through the wilderness,  through a land of deserts and of pits,  through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,  through a land that no one passed through,  and where no man lived?’  <span class="verse">7</span> I brought you into a plentiful land  to eat its fruit and its goodness;  but when you entered, you defiled my land,  and made my heritage an abomination.  <span class="verse">8</span> The priests didn’t say, ‘Where is Yahweh?’  and those who handle the law didn’t know me.  The rulers also transgressed against me,  and the prophets prophesied by Baal  and followed things that do not profit.  <span class="verse">9</span> “Therefore I will yet contend with you,” says Yahweh,  “and I will contend with your children’s children.  <span class="verse">10</span> For pass over to the islands of Kittim, and see.  Send to Kedar, and consider diligently,  and see if there has been such a thing.  <span class="verse">11</span> Has a nation changed its gods,  which really are no gods?  But my people have changed their glory for that which doesn’t profit.  <span class="verse">12</span> “Be astonished, you heavens, at this  and be horribly afraid.  Be very desolate,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">13</span> “For my people have committed two evils:  they have forsaken me, the spring of living waters,  and cut out cisterns for themselves: broken cisterns that can’t hold water.  <span class="verse">14</span> Is Israel a slave?  Is he born into slavery?  Why has he become a captive?  <span class="verse">15</span> The young lions have roared at him and yelled.  They have made his land waste.  His cities are burned up, without inhabitant.  <span class="verse">16</span> The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the crown of your head.  <span class="verse">17</span> “Haven’t you brought this on yourself,  in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,  when he led you by the way?  <span class="verse">18</span> Now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor?  Or why do you to go on the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River? <span class="verse">19</span> “Your own wickedness will correct you,  and your backsliding will rebuke you.  Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing,  that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,  and that my fear is not in you,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">20</span> “For long ago I broke off your yoke,  and burst your bonds.  You said, ‘I will not serve;’  for on every high hill and under every green tree you bowed yourself,  playing the prostitute.  <span class="verse">21</span> Yet I had planted you a noble vine,  a pure and faithful seed.  How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?  <span class="verse">22</span> For though you wash yourself with lye,  and use much soap,  yet your iniquity is marked before me,” says the Lord Yahweh.  <span class="verse">23</span> “How can you say, ‘I am not defiled.  I have not gone after the Baals’?  See your way in the valley.  Know what you have done.  You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways,   <span class="verse">24</span> a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that sniffs the wind in her craving.  When she is in heat, who can turn her away?  All those who seek her will not weary themselves. In her month, they will find her.  <span class="verse">25</span> “Keep your feet from being bare,  and your throat from thirst.  But you said, ‘It is in vain.  No, for I have loved strangers,  and I will go after them.’  <span class="verse">26</span> As the thief is ashamed when he is found,  so the house of Israel is ashamed:  they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,  <span class="verse">27</span> who tell wood, ‘You are my father,’  and a stone, ‘You have given birth to me,’  for they have turned their back to me,  and not their face;  but in the time of their trouble they will say, ‘Arise, and save us!’  <span class="verse">28</span> “But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?  Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble;  for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.  <span class="verse">29</span> “Why will you contend with me?  You all have transgressed against me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">30</span> “I have struck your children in vain.  They received no correction.  Your own sword has devoured your prophets,  like a destroying lion.  <span class="verse">31</span> Generation, consider Yahweh’s word.  Have I been a wilderness to Israel?  Or a land of thick darkness?  Why do my people say, ‘We have broken loose.  We will come to you no more?’  <span class="verse">32</span> “Can a virgin forget her ornaments,  or a bride her attire?  Yet my people have forgotten me for days without number.  <span class="verse">33</span> How well you prepare your way to seek love!  Therefore you have even taught the wicked women your ways.  <span class="verse">34</span> Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts.  You didn’t find them breaking in,  but it is because of all these things.  <span class="verse">35</span> “Yet you said, ‘I am innocent.  Surely his anger has turned away from me.’  “Behold, I will judge you,  because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’  <span class="verse">36</span> Why do you go about so much to change your ways?  You will be ashamed of Egypt also,  as you were ashamed of Assyria.  <span class="verse">37</span> You will also leave that place with your hands on your head;  for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust,  and you won’t prosper with them.

		<span class="reference">Ecclesiastes 1</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:  <span class="verse">2</span> “Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”   <span class="verse">3</span> What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?   <span class="verse">4</span> One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.   <span class="verse">5</span> The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.   <span class="verse">6</span> The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.   <span class="verse">7</span> All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.   <span class="verse">8</span> All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.   <span class="verse">9</span> That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.   <span class="verse">10</span> Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,  this is new?” It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.   <span class="verse">11</span> There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.  <span class="verse">12</span> I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">13</span> I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God  has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.   <span class="verse">14</span> I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.   <span class="verse">15</span> That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.   <span class="verse">16</span> I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”   <span class="verse">17</span> I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.   <span class="verse">18</span> For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
