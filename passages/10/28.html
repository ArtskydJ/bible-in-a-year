		<span class="reference">Lamentations 1</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> How the city sits solitary,  that was full of people!  She has become as a widow,  who was great among the nations!  She who was a princess among the provinces  has become a slave!  <span class="verse">2</span> She weeps bitterly in the night.  Her tears are on her cheeks.  Among all her lovers  she has no one to comfort her.  All her friends have dealt treacherously with her.  They have become her enemies.  <span class="verse">3</span> Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction,  and because of great servitude.  She dwells among the nations.  She finds no rest.  All her persecutors overtook her within the straits.  <span class="verse">4</span> The roads to Zion mourn,  because no one comes to the solemn assembly.  All her gates are desolate.  Her priests sigh.  Her virgins are afflicted,  and she herself is in bitterness.  <span class="verse">5</span> Her adversaries have become the head.  Her enemies prosper;  for Yahweh  has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions.  Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.  <span class="verse">6</span> All majesty has departed from the daughter of Zion.  Her princes have become like deer that find no pasture.  They have gone without strength before the pursuer.  <span class="verse">7</span> Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries  all her pleasant things that were from the days of old;  when her people fell into the hand of the adversary,  and no one helped her.  The adversaries saw her.  They mocked at her desolations.  <span class="verse">8</span> Jerusalem has grievously sinned.  Therefore she has become unclean.  All who honored her despise her,  because they have seen her nakedness.  Yes, she sighs, and turns backward.  <span class="verse">9</span> Her filthiness was in her skirts.  She didn’t remember her latter end.  Therefore she has come down astoundingly.  She has no comforter.  “See, Yahweh, my affliction;  for the enemy has magnified himself.”  <span class="verse">10</span> The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things;  for she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary,  concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.  <span class="verse">11</span> All her people sigh.  They seek bread.  They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh their soul.  “Look, Yahweh, and see;  for I have become despised.”  <span class="verse">12</span> “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?  Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,  which is brought on me,  with which Yahweh has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.  <span class="verse">13</span> “From on high has he sent fire into my bones,  and it prevails against them.  He has spread a net for my feet.  He has turned me back.  He has made me desolate and I faint all day long.  <span class="verse">14</span> “The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand.  They are knit together.  They have come up on my neck.  He made my strength fail.  The Lord  has delivered me into their hands,  against whom I am not able to stand.  <span class="verse">15</span> “The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men within me.  He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men.  The Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a wine press.  <span class="verse">16</span> “For these things I weep.  My eye, my eye runs down with water,  because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me.  My children are desolate,  because the enemy has prevailed.”  <span class="verse">17</span> Zion spreads out her hands.  There is no one to comfort her.  Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob,  that those who are around him should be his adversaries.  Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.  <span class="verse">18</span> “Yahweh is righteous;  for I have rebelled against his commandment.  Please hear all you peoples,  and see my sorrow.  My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.  <span class="verse">19</span> “I called for my lovers,  but they deceived me.  My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city,  while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls.  <span class="verse">20</span> “Look, Yahweh; for I am in distress.  My heart is troubled.  My heart turns over within me,  for I have grievously rebelled.  Abroad, the sword bereaves.  At home, it is like death.  <span class="verse">21</span> “They have heard that I sigh.  There is no one to comfort me.  All my enemies have heard of my trouble.  They are glad that you have done it.  You will bring the day that you have proclaimed,  and they will be like me.  <span class="verse">22</span> “Let all their wickedness come before you.  Do to them as you have done to me for all my transgressions.  For my sighs are many,  and my heart is faint.

Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you?  <span class="verse">2</span> My beloved has gone down to his garden,  to the beds of spices,  to pasture his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies.  <span class="verse">3</span> I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine.  He browses among the lilies.  <span class="verse">4</span> You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah,  lovely as Jerusalem,  awesome as an army with banners.  <span class="verse">5</span> Turn away your eyes from me,  for they have overcome me.  Your hair is like a flock of goats,  that lie along the side of Gilead.  <span class="verse">6</span> Your teeth are like a flock of ewes,  which have come up from the washing,  of which every one has twins;  not one is bereaved among them.  <span class="verse">7</span> Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.  <span class="verse">8</span> There are sixty queens, eighty concubines,  and virgins without number.  <span class="verse">9</span> My dove, my perfect one, is unique.  She is her mother’s only daughter.  She is the favorite one of her who bore her.  The daughters saw her, and called her blessed.  The queens and the concubines saw her, and they praised her.  <span class="verse">10</span> Who is she who looks out as the morning,  beautiful as the moon,  clear as the sun,  and awesome as an army with banners?  <span class="verse">11</span> I went down into the nut tree grove,  to see the green plants of the valley,  to see whether the vine budded,  and the pomegranates were in flower.  <span class="verse">12</span> Without realizing it,  my desire set me with my royal people’s chariots.  <span class="verse">13</span> Return, return, Shulammite!  Return, return, that we may gaze at you.  Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite,  as at the dance of Mahanaim?

Who can listen to it?”  <span class="verse">61</span> But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this, said to them,  “Does this cause you to stumble?  <span class="verse">62</span> Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before?  <span class="verse">63</span> It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.  <span class="verse">64</span> But there are some of you who don’t believe.”  For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn’t believe, and who it was who would betray him.   <span class="verse">65</span> He said,  “For this cause I have said to you that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.” <span class="verse">66</span> At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.   <span class="verse">67</span> Jesus said therefore to the twelve,  “You don’t also want to go away, do you?” <span class="verse">68</span> Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.   <span class="verse">69</span> We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”  <span class="verse">70</span> Jesus answered them,  “Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?” <span class="verse">71</span> Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.
