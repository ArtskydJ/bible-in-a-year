		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 33-34</span>  <span class="chapter">33</span><span class="verse">1</span> Moreover Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still locked up in the court of the guard, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Yahweh who does it, Yahweh who forms it to establish it—Yahweh is his name, says:   <span class="verse">3</span> ‘Call to me, and I will answer you, and will show you great and difficult things, which you don’t know.’   <span class="verse">4</span> For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword;   <span class="verse">5</span> while men come to fight with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath, and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city:   <span class="verse">6</span> ‘Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.   <span class="verse">7</span> I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first.   <span class="verse">8</span> I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me. I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me.   <span class="verse">9</span> This city will be to me for a name of joy, for praise, and for glory, before all the nations of the earth, which will hear all the good that I do to them, and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.’ ”  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh says: “Yet again there will be heard in this place, about which you say, ‘It is waste, without man and without animal, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’   <span class="verse">11</span> the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say, ‘Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies, for Yahweh is good, for his loving kindness endures forever;’ who bring thanksgiving into Yahweh’s house. For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed as at the first,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">12</span> Yahweh of Armies says: “Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without animal, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.   <span class="verse">13</span> In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of him who counts them,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">14</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.  <span class="verse">15</span> “In those days and at that time,  I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David.  He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.  <span class="verse">16</span> In those days Judah will be saved,  and Jerusalem will dwell safely.  This is the name by which she will be called:  Yahweh our righteousness.”  <span class="verse">17</span> For Yahweh says: “David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel.   <span class="verse">18</span> The Levitical priests won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn meal offerings, and to do sacrifice continually.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse">20</span> “Yahweh says: ‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their time;   <span class="verse">21</span> then may my covenant also be broken with David my servant, that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.   <span class="verse">22</span> As the army of the sky can’t be counted, and the sand of the sea can’t be measured; so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’ ”  <span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying,   <span class="verse">24</span> “Don’t consider what this people has spoken, saying, ‘Has Yahweh cast off the two families which he chose?’ Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.”   <span class="verse">25</span> Yahweh says: “If my covenant of day and night fails, if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;   <span class="verse">26</span> then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob, and of David my servant, so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.”   <span class="chapter">34</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, with all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying:   <span class="verse">2</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, ‘Go, and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Yahweh says, “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire.   <span class="verse">3</span> You won’t escape out of his hand, but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand. Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he will speak with you mouth to mouth. You will go to Babylon.” ’  <span class="verse">4</span> “Yet hear Yahweh’s word, O Zedekiah king of Judah: Yahweh says concerning you, ‘You won’t die by the sword.   <span class="verse">5</span> You will die in peace; and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will make a burning for you. They will lament you, saying, “Ah Lord!” for I have spoken the word,’ says Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,   <span class="verse">7</span> when the king of Babylon’s army was fighting against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and against Azekah; for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.  <span class="verse">8</span> The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;   <span class="verse">9</span> that every man should let his male servant, and every man his female servant, who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that no one should make bondservants of them, of a Jew his brother.   <span class="verse">10</span> All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant, that everyone should let his male servant, and everyone his female servant go free, that no one should make bondservants of them any more. They obeyed and let them go;   <span class="verse">11</span> but afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.  <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,   <span class="verse">13</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,   <span class="verse">14</span> At the end of seven years, every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and has served you six years. You shall let him go free from you; but your fathers didn’t listen to me, and didn’t incline their ear.   <span class="verse">15</span> You had now turned, and had done that which is right in my eyes, in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor. You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name;   <span class="verse">16</span> but you turned and profaned my name, and every man caused his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had let go free at their pleasure, to return. You brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids.’ ”  <span class="verse">17</span> Therefore Yahweh says: “You have not listened to me, to proclaim liberty, every man to his brother, and every man to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim to you a liberty,” says Yahweh, “to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine. I will make you be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.   <span class="verse">18</span> I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts:   <span class="verse">19</span> the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf;   <span class="verse">20</span> I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.  <span class="verse">21</span> “I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hands of their enemies, into the hands of those who seek their life and into the hands of the king of Babylon’s army, who has gone away from you.   <span class="verse">22</span> Behold, I will command,” says Yahweh, “and cause them to return to this city. They will fight against it, take it, and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”

As the fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falls suddenly on them.  <span class="verse">13</span> I have also seen wisdom under the sun in this way, and it seemed great to me.   <span class="verse">14</span> There was a little city, and few men within it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it.   <span class="verse">15</span> Now a poor wise man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.   <span class="verse">16</span> Then I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” Nevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.   <span class="verse">17</span> The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the cry of him who rules among fools.   <span class="verse">18</span> Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but one sinner destroys much good.

Whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had. <span class="verse">5</span> A certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years.   <span class="verse">6</span> When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him,  “Do you want to be made well?” <span class="verse">7</span> The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Jesus said to him,  “Arise, take up your mat, and walk.” <span class="verse">9</span> Immediately, the man was made well, and took up his mat and walked.  Now it was the Sabbath on that day.   <span class="verse">10</span> So the Jews said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.”  <span class="verse">11</span> He answered them, “He who made me well said to me,  ‘Take up your mat and walk.’ ”  <span class="verse">12</span> Then they asked him, “Who is the man who said to you,  ‘Take up your mat and walk’ ?”  <span class="verse">13</span> But he who was healed didn’t know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.  <span class="verse">14</span> Afterward Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him,  “Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse happens to you.”  <span class="verse">15</span> The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
