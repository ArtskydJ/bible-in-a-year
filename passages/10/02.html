		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 3-4</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> “They say, ‘If a man puts away his wife, and she goes from him, and becomes another man’s, should he return to her again?’ Wouldn’t that land be greatly polluted? But you have played the prostitute with many lovers; yet return again to me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">2</span> “Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? You have sat waiting for them by the road, as an Arabian in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.   <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore the showers have been withheld and there has been no latter rain; yet you have had a prostitute’s forehead and you refused to be ashamed.   <span class="verse">4</span> Will you not from this time cry to me, ‘My Father, you are the guide of my youth?’  <span class="verse">5</span> “ ‘Will he retain his anger forever? Will he keep it to the end?’ Behold, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Moreover, Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, “Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and has played the prostitute there.   <span class="verse">7</span> I said after she had done all these things, ‘She will return to me;’ but she didn’t return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.   <span class="verse">8</span> I saw when, for this very cause, that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce, yet treacherous Judah, her sister, had no fear; but she also went and played the prostitute.   <span class="verse">9</span> Because she took her prostitution lightly, the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with wood.   <span class="verse">10</span> Yet for all this her treacherous sister, Judah, has not returned to me with her whole heart, but only in pretense,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said to me, “Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.   <span class="verse">12</span> Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, ‘Return, you backsliding Israel,’ says Yahweh; ‘I will not look in anger on you; for I am merciful,’ says Yahweh. ‘I will not keep anger forever.   <span class="verse">13</span> Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice,’ says Yahweh.”   <span class="verse">14</span> “Return, backsliding children,” says Yahweh; “for I am a husband to you. I will take one of you from a city, and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.   <span class="verse">15</span> I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.   <span class="verse">16</span> It will come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days,” says Yahweh, “they will no longer say, ‘the ark of Yahweh’s covenant!’ It will not come to mind. They won’t remember it. They won’t miss it, nor will another be made.   <span class="verse">17</span> At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘Yahweh’s Throne;’ and all the nations will be gathered to it, to Yahweh’s name, to Jerusalem. They will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.   <span class="verse">18</span> In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.  <span class="verse">19</span> “But I said, ‘How I desire to put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said, ‘You shall call me “My Father”, and shall not turn away from following me.’  <span class="verse">20</span> “Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so you have dealt treacherously with me, house of Israel,” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">21</span> A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.   <span class="verse">22</span> Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backsliding.  “Behold, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.   <span class="verse">23</span> Truly help from the hills, the tumult on the mountains, is in vain. Truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God.   <span class="verse">24</span> But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.   <span class="verse">25</span> Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day. We have not obeyed Yahweh our God’s voice.”   <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> “If you will return, Israel,” says Yahweh, “if you will return to me, and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight; then you will not be removed;   <span class="verse">2</span> and you will swear, ‘As Yahweh lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness. The nations will bless themselves in him, and they will glory in him.”  <span class="verse">3</span> For Yahweh says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, “Break up your fallow ground, and don’t sow among thorns.   <span class="verse">4</span> Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh, and take away the foreskins of your heart, you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go out like fire, and burn so that no one can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.   <span class="verse">5</span> Declare in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, ‘Blow the trumpet in the land!’ Cry aloud and say, ‘Assemble yourselves! Let’s go into the fortified cities!’   <span class="verse">6</span> Set up a standard toward Zion. Flee for safety! Don’t wait; for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction.”  <span class="verse">7</span> A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations. He is on his way. He has gone out from his place, to make your land desolate, that your cities be laid waste, without inhabitant.   <span class="verse">8</span> For this, clothe yourself with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn’t turned back from us.   <span class="verse">9</span> “It will happen at that day,” says Yahweh, “that the heart of the king will perish, along with the heart of the princes. The priests will be astonished, and the prophets will wonder.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.”  <span class="verse">11</span> At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;   <span class="verse">12</span> a full wind from these will come for me. Now I will also utter judgments against them.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Behold, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots will be as the whirlwind. His horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.   <span class="verse">14</span> Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge within you?   <span class="verse">15</span> For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:   <span class="verse">16</span> “Tell the nations, behold, publish against Jerusalem, ‘Watchers come from a far country, and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.   <span class="verse">17</span> As keepers of a field, they are against her all around, because she has been rebellious against me,’ ” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">18</span> “Your way and your doings have brought these things to you. This is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.”  <span class="verse">19</span> My anguish, my anguish! I am pained at my very heart! My heart trembles within me. I can’t hold my peace, because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.   <span class="verse">20</span> Destruction on destruction is decreed, for the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, and my curtains gone in a moment.   <span class="verse">21</span> How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?  <span class="verse">22</span> “For my people are foolish. They don’t know me. They are foolish children, and they have no understanding. They are skillful in doing evil, but they don’t know how to do good.”   <span class="verse">23</span> I saw the earth, and, behold, it was waste and void, and the heavens, and they had no light.   <span class="verse">24</span> I saw the mountains, and behold, they trembled, and all the hills moved back and forth.   <span class="verse">25</span> I saw, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the sky had fled.   <span class="verse">26</span> I saw, and behold, the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, before his fierce anger.   <span class="verse">27</span> For Yahweh says, “The whole land will be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.   <span class="verse">28</span> For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black, because I have spoken it. I have planned it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.”  <span class="verse">29</span> Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers. They go into the thickets, and climb up on the rocks. Every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.   <span class="verse">30</span> You, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you clothe yourself with scarlet, though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with makeup, you make yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers despise you. They seek your life.   <span class="verse">31</span> For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who gives birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, saying, “Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.”

I built myself houses. I planted myself vineyards.   <span class="verse">5</span> I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit.   <span class="verse">6</span> I made myself pools of water, to water from it the forest where trees were grown.   <span class="verse">7</span> I bought male servants and female servants, and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">8</span> I also gathered silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself male and female singers, and the delights of the sons of men: musical instruments, and that of all sorts.

We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.   <span class="verse">15</span> John testified about him. He cried out, saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me, for he was before me.’ ”   <span class="verse">16</span> From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.   <span class="verse">17</span> For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse">18</span> No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son,  who is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him.

The sin, when it is full grown, produces death.   <span class="verse">16</span> Don’t be deceived, my beloved brothers.   <span class="verse">17</span> Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow.   <span class="verse">18</span> Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
