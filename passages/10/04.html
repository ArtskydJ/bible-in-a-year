		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 7-9</span>  <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Stand in the gate of Yahweh’s house, and proclaim this word there, and say, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, all you of Judah, who enter in at these gates to worship Yahweh.’ ”  <span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says, “Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.   <span class="verse">4</span> Don’t trust in lying words, saying, ‘Yahweh’s temple, Yahweh’s temple, Yahweh’s temple, are these.’   <span class="verse">5</span> For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;   <span class="verse">6</span> if you don’t oppress the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, and don’t shed innocent blood in this place, and don’t walk after other gods to your own hurt;   <span class="verse">7</span> then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even forever more.   <span class="verse">8</span> Behold, you trust in lying words that can’t profit.   <span class="verse">9</span> Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods that you have not known,   <span class="verse">10</span> then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered,’ that you may do all these abominations?   <span class="verse">11</span> Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">12</span> “But go now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.   <span class="verse">13</span> Now, because you have done all these works,” says Yahweh, “and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you didn’t hear; and I called you, but you didn’t answer;   <span class="verse">14</span> therefore I will do to the house which is called by my name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.   <span class="verse">15</span> I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole offspring  of Ephraim.  <span class="verse">16</span> “Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up a cry or prayer for them or make intercession to me; for I will not hear you.   <span class="verse">17</span> Don’t you see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?   <span class="verse">18</span> The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of the sky, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.   <span class="verse">19</span> Do they provoke me to anger?” says Yahweh. “Don’t they provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?”  <span class="verse">20</span> Therefore the Lord Yahweh says: “Behold, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, on man, on animal, on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and will not be quenched.”  <span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat meat.   <span class="verse">22</span> For I didn’t speak to your fathers or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices;   <span class="verse">23</span> but this thing I commanded them, saying, ‘Listen to my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. Walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.’   <span class="verse">24</span> But they didn’t listen or turn their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.   <span class="verse">25</span> Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them.   <span class="verse">26</span> Yet they didn’t listen to me or incline their ear, but made their neck stiff. They did worse than their fathers.  <span class="verse">27</span> “You shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall also call to them, but they will not answer you.   <span class="verse">28</span> You shall tell them, ‘This is the nation that has not listened to Yahweh their God’s voice, nor received instruction. Truth has perished, and is cut off from their mouth.’   <span class="verse">29</span> Cut off your hair, and throw it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for Yahweh has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.  <span class="verse">30</span> “For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight,” says Yahweh. “They have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.   <span class="verse">31</span> They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I didn’t command, nor did it come into my mind.   <span class="verse">32</span> Therefore behold, the days come”, says Yahweh, “that it will no more be called ‘Topheth’ or ‘The valley of the son of Hinnom’, but ‘The valley of Slaughter’; for they will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.   <span class="verse">33</span> The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky, and for the animals of the earth. No one will frighten them away.   <span class="verse">34</span> Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a waste.”   <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">1</span> “At that time,” says Yahweh, “they will bring the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of his princes, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves.   <span class="verse">2</span> They will spread them before the sun, the moon, and all the army of the sky, which they have loved, which they have served, after which they have walked, which they have sought, and which they have worshiped. They will not be gathered or be buried. They will be like dung on the surface of the earth.   <span class="verse">3</span> Death will be chosen rather than life by all the residue that remain of this evil family, that remain in all the places where I have driven them,” says Yahweh of Armies.   <span class="verse">4</span> “Moreover you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh says:  “ ‘Do men fall, and not rise up again?  Does one turn away, and not return?  <span class="verse">5</span> Why then have the people of Jerusalem fallen back by a perpetual backsliding?  They cling to deceit.  They refuse to return.  <span class="verse">6</span> I listened and heard, but they didn’t say what is right.  No one repents of his wickedness, saying, “What have I done?”  Everyone turns to his course,  as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle.  <span class="verse">7</span> Yes, the stork in the sky knows her appointed times.  The turtledove, the swallow, and the crane observe the time of their coming;  but my people don’t know Yahweh’s law.  <span class="verse">8</span> “ ‘How do you say, “We are wise, and Yahweh’s law is with us?”  But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has made that a lie.  <span class="verse">9</span> The wise men are disappointed.  They are dismayed and trapped.  Behold, they have rejected Yahweh’s word.  What kind of wisdom is in them?  <span class="verse">10</span> Therefore I will give their wives to others  and their fields to those who will possess them.  For everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness;  from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.  <span class="verse">11</span> They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying,  “Peace, peace,” when there is no peace.  <span class="verse">12</span> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?  No, they were not at all ashamed.  They couldn’t blush.  Therefore they will fall among those who fall.  In the time of their visitation they will be cast down, says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">13</span> “ ‘I will utterly consume them, says Yahweh.  No grapes will be on the vine,  no figs on the fig tree,  and the leaf will fade.  The things that I have given them  will pass away from them.’ ”  <span class="verse">14</span> “Why do we sit still?  Assemble yourselves!  Let’s enter into the fortified cities,  and let’s be silent there;  for Yahweh our God has put us to silence,  and given us poisoned water to drink,  because we have sinned against Yahweh.  <span class="verse">15</span> We looked for peace, but no good came;  and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!  <span class="verse">16</span> The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan.  The whole land trembles at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones;  for they have come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it,  the city and those who dwell therein.”  <span class="verse">17</span> “For, behold, I will send serpents,  adders among you,  which will not be charmed;  and they will bite you,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">18</span> Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow!  My heart is faint within me.  <span class="verse">19</span> Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off:  “Isn’t Yahweh in Zion?  Isn’t her King in her?”  “Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images,  and with foreign idols?”  <span class="verse">20</span> “The harvest is past.  The summer has ended,  and we are not saved.”  <span class="verse">21</span> For the hurt of the daughter of my people, I am hurt.  I mourn.  Dismay has taken hold of me.  <span class="verse">22</span> Is there no balm in Gilead?  Is there no physician there?  Why then isn’t the health of the daughter of my people recovered?   <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">1</span> Oh that my head were waters,  and my eyes a spring of tears,  that I might weep day and night  for the slain of the daughter of my people!  <span class="verse">2</span> Oh that I had in the wilderness  a lodging place of wayfaring men;  that I might leave my people,  and go from them!  For they are all adulterers,  an assembly of treacherous men.  <span class="verse">3</span> “They bend their tongue,  as their bow, for falsehood.  They have grown strong in the land,  but not for truth;  for they proceed from evil to evil,  and they don’t know me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Everyone beware of his neighbor,  and don’t trust in any brother;  for every brother will utterly supplant,  and every neighbor will go around like a slanderer.  <span class="verse">5</span> Friends deceive each other,  and will not speak the truth.  They have taught their tongue to speak lies.  They weary themselves commiting iniquity.  <span class="verse">6</span> Your habitation is in the middle of deceit.  Through deceit, they refuse to know me,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">7</span> Therefore Yahweh of Armies says,  “Behold, I will melt them and test them;  for how should I deal with the daughter of my people?  <span class="verse">8</span> Their tongue is a deadly arrow.  It speaks deceit.  One speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth,  but in his heart, he waits to ambush him.  <span class="verse">9</span> Shouldn’t I punish them for these things?” says Yahweh.  “Shouldn’t my soul be avenged on a nation such as this?  <span class="verse">10</span> I will weep and wail for the mountains,  and lament for the pastures of the wilderness,  because they are burned up, so that no one passes through;  Men can’t hear the voice of the livestock.  Both the birds of the sky and the animals have fled.  They are gone.  <span class="verse">11</span> “I will make Jerusalem heaps,  a dwelling place of jackals.  I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,  without inhabitant.”  <span class="verse">12</span> Who is wise enough to understand this? Who is he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken, that he may declare it? Why has the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that no one passes through?  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh says, “Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in my ways,   <span class="verse">14</span> but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them.”   <span class="verse">15</span> Therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says, “Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink.   <span class="verse">16</span> I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”  <span class="verse">17</span> Yahweh of Armies says,  “Consider, and call for the mourning women, that they may come.  Send for the skillful women, that they may come.  <span class="verse">18</span> Let them make haste  and take up a wailing for us,  that our eyes may run down with tears  and our eyelids gush out with waters.  <span class="verse">19</span> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion,  ‘How we are ruined!  We are greatly confounded  because we have forsaken the land,  because they have cast down our dwellings.’ ”  <span class="verse">20</span> Yet hear Yahweh’s word, you women.  Let your ear receive the word of his mouth.  Teach your daughters wailing.  Everyone teach her neighbor a lamentation.  <span class="verse">21</span> For death has come up into our windows.  It has entered into our palaces  to cut off the children from outside,  and the young men from the streets.  <span class="verse">22</span> Speak, “Yahweh says,  “ ‘The dead bodies of men will fall as dung on the open field,  and as the handful after the harvester.  No one will gather them.’ ”  <span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh says,  “Don’t let the wise man glory in his wisdom.  Don’t let the mighty man glory in his might.  Don’t let the rich man glory in his riches.  <span class="verse">24</span> But let him who glories glory in this,  that he has understanding, and knows me,  that I am Yahweh who exercises loving kindness, justice, and righteousness in the earth,  for I delight in these things,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">25</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that I will punish all those who are circumcised only in their flesh:   <span class="verse">26</span> Egypt, Judah, Edom, the children of Ammon, Moab, and all who have the corners of their hair cut off, who dwell in the wilderness, for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.”

		<span class="reference">Ecclesiastes 2:17-26</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">17</span> So I hated life, because the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a chasing after wind.   <span class="verse">18</span> I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes after me.   <span class="verse">19</span> Who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.  <span class="verse">20</span> Therefore I began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.   <span class="verse">21</span> For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.   <span class="verse">22</span> For what does a man have of all his labor and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?   <span class="verse">23</span> For all his days are sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.   <span class="verse">24</span> There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.   <span class="verse">25</span> For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?   <span class="verse">26</span> For to the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.
