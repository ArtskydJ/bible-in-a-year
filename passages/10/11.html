		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 23-25</span>  <span class="chapter">23</span><span class="verse">1</span> “Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">2</span> Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says against the shepherds who feed my people: “You have scattered my flock, driven them away, and have not visited them. Behold, I will visit on you the evil of your doings,” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">3</span> “I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they will be fruitful and multiply.   <span class="verse">4</span> I will set up shepherds over them, who will feed them. They will no longer be afraid or dismayed, neither will any be lacking,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">5</span> “Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,  “that I will raise to David a righteous Branch,  and he will reign as king and deal wisely,  and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.  <span class="verse">6</span> In his days Judah will be saved,  and Israel will dwell safely.  This is his name by which he will be called:  Yahweh our righteousness.  <span class="verse">7</span> “Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that they will no more say, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’   <span class="verse">8</span> but, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up and who led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will dwell in their own land.”  <span class="verse">9</span> Concerning the prophets:  My heart within me is broken.  All my bones shake.  I am like a drunken man,  and like a man whom wine has overcome,  because of Yahweh,  and because of his holy words.  <span class="verse">10</span> For the land is full of adulterers;  for because of the curse the land mourns.  The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.  Their course is evil,  and their might is not right;  <span class="verse">11</span> for both prophet and priest are profane.  Yes, in my house I have found their wickedness,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness.  They will be driven on,  and fall therein;  for I will bring evil on them,  even the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">13</span> “I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria.  They prophesied by Baal,  and caused my people Israel to err.  <span class="verse">14</span> In the prophets of Jerusalem I have also seen a horrible thing:  they commit adultery and walk in lies.  They strengthen the hands of evildoers,  so that no one returns from his wickedness.  They have all become to me as Sodom,  and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Therefore Yahweh of Armies says concerning the prophets:  “Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,  and make them drink poisoned water;  for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh of Armies says,  “Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.  They teach you vanity.  They speak a vision of their own heart,  and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.  <span class="verse">17</span> They say continually to those who despise me,  ‘Yahweh has said, “You will have peace;” ’  and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say,  ‘No evil will come on you.’  <span class="verse">18</span> For who has stood in the council of Yahweh,  that he should perceive and hear his word?  Who has listened to my word, and heard it?  <span class="verse">19</span> Behold, Yahweh’s storm, his wrath, has gone out.  Yes, a whirling storm:  It will burst on the head of the wicked.  <span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh’s anger will not return until he has executed,  and until he has performed the intents of his heart.  In the latter days, you will understand it perfectly.  <span class="verse">21</span> I didn’t send these prophets, yet they ran.  I didn’t speak to them, yet they prophesied.  <span class="verse">22</span> But if they had stood in my council,  then they would have caused my people to hear my words,  and would have turned them from their evil way,  and from the evil of their doings.  <span class="verse">23</span> “Am I a God at hand,” says Yahweh,  “and not a God afar off?  <span class="verse">24</span> Can anyone hide himself in secret places  so that I can’t see him?” says Yahweh.  “Don’t I fill heaven and earth?” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">25</span> “I have heard what the prophets have said, who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’   <span class="verse">26</span> How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?   <span class="verse">27</span> They intend to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they each tell his neighbor, as their fathers forgot my name because of Baal.   <span class="verse">28</span> The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat?” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">29</span> “Isn’t my word like fire?” says Yahweh; “and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?  <span class="verse">30</span> “Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who each steal my words from his neighbor.   <span class="verse">31</span> Behold, I am against the prophets,” says Yahweh, “who use their tongues, and say, ‘He says.’   <span class="verse">32</span> Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,” says Yahweh, “who tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting; yet I didn’t send them or command them. They don’t profit this people at all,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">33</span> “When this people, or the prophet, or a priest, asks you, saying, ‘What is the message from Yahweh?’ Then you shall tell them, ‘ “What message? I will cast you off,” says Yahweh.’   <span class="verse">34</span> As for the prophet, the priest, and the people, who say, ‘The message from Yahweh,’ I will even punish that man and his household.   <span class="verse">35</span> You will say everyone to his neighbor, and everyone to his brother, ‘What has Yahweh answered?’ and, ‘What has Yahweh said?’   <span class="verse">36</span> You will mention the message from Yahweh no more: for every man’s own word has become his message; for you have perverted the words of the living God, of Yahweh of Armies, our God.   <span class="verse">37</span> You will say to the prophet, ‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ and, ‘What has Yahweh spoken?’   <span class="verse">38</span> Although you say, ‘The message from Yahweh;’ therefore Yahweh says: ‘Because you say this word, “The message from Yahweh,” and I have sent to you, telling you not to say, “The message from Yahweh;”   <span class="verse">39</span> therefore, behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will cast you off, and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers, away from my presence.   <span class="verse">40</span> I will bring an everlasting reproach on you, and a perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.’ ”   <span class="chapter">24</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before Yahweh’s temple, after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the craftsmen and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.   <span class="verse">2</span> One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first-ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.  <span class="verse">3</span> Then Yahweh asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”  I said, “Figs. The good figs are very good, and the bad are very bad, so bad that can’t be eaten.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">5</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans, for good.   <span class="verse">6</span> For I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them again to this land. I will build them, and not pull them down. I will plant them, and not pluck them up.   <span class="verse">7</span> I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Yahweh. They will be my people, and I will be their God; for they will return to me with their whole heart.  <span class="verse">8</span> “ ‘As the bad figs, which can’t be eaten, they are so bad,’ surely Yahweh says, ‘So I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse">9</span> I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil; to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I will drive them.   <span class="verse">10</span> I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.’ ”   <span class="chapter">25</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (this was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),   <span class="verse">2</span> which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:   <span class="verse">3</span> From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, Yahweh’s word has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened.  <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear),   <span class="verse">5</span> saying, “Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forever more.   <span class="verse">6</span> Don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; then I will do you no harm.”  <span class="verse">7</span> “Yet you have not listened to me,” says Yahweh; “that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Therefore Yahweh of Armies says: “Because you have not heard my words,   <span class="verse">9</span> behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,” says Yahweh, “and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around. I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.   <span class="verse">10</span> Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.   <span class="verse">11</span> This whole land will be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.  <span class="verse">12</span> “It will happen, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,” says Yahweh, “for their iniquity. I will make the land of the Chaldeans desolate forever.   <span class="verse">13</span> I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.   <span class="verse">14</span> For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them, even of them. I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.”  <span class="verse">15</span> For Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from my hand, and cause all the nations to whom I send you to drink it.   <span class="verse">16</span> They will drink, and reel back and forth, and be insane, because of the sword that I will send among them.”  <span class="verse">17</span> Then I took the cup at Yahweh’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom Yahweh had sent me:   <span class="verse">18</span> Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, with its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is today;   <span class="verse">19</span> Pharaoh king of Egypt, with his servants, his princes, and all his people;   <span class="verse">20</span> and all the mixed people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;   <span class="verse">21</span> Edom, Moab, and the children of Ammon;   <span class="verse">22</span> and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea;   <span class="verse">23</span> Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who have the corners of their beard cut off;   <span class="verse">24</span> and all the kings of Arabia, all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness;   <span class="verse">25</span> and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes;   <span class="verse">26</span> and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are on the surface of the earth. The king of Sheshach will drink after them.  <span class="verse">27</span> “You shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Drink, and be drunk, vomit, fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.” ’   <span class="verse">28</span> It shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink, then you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh of Armies says: “You shall surely drink.   <span class="verse">29</span> For, behold, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should you be utterly unpunished? You will not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says Yahweh of Armies.” ’  <span class="verse">30</span> “Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and tell them,  “ ‘Yahweh will roar from on high,  and utter his voice from his holy habitation.  He will mightily roar against his fold.  He will give a shout, as those who tread grapes,  against all the inhabitants of the earth.  <span class="verse">31</span> A noise will come even to the end of the earth;  for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations.  He will enter into judgment with all flesh.  As for the wicked, he will give them to the sword,” ’ says Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">32</span> Yahweh of Armies says,  “Behold, evil will go out from nation to nation,  and a great storm will be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.”  <span class="verse">33</span> The slain of Yahweh will be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They won’t be lamented. They won’t be gathered or buried. They will be dung on the surface of the ground.  <span class="verse">34</span> Wail, you shepherds, and cry.  Wallow in dust, you leader of the flock;  for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come,  and you will fall like fine pottery.  <span class="verse">35</span> The shepherds will have no way to flee.  The leader of the flock will have no escape.  <span class="verse">36</span> A voice of the cry of the shepherds,  and the wailing of the leader of the flock,  for Yahweh destroys their pasture.  <span class="verse">37</span> The peaceful folds are brought to silence  because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.  <span class="verse">38</span> He has left his covert, as the lion;  for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression,  and because of his fierce anger.

This also is vanity.   <span class="verse">7</span> Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish; and a bribe destroys the understanding.   <span class="verse">8</span> Better is the end of a thing than its beginning.  The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.   <span class="verse">9</span> Don’t be hasty in your spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.   <span class="verse">10</span> Don’t say, “Why were the former days better than these?” For you do not ask wisely about this.  <span class="verse">11</span> Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. Yes, it is more excellent for those who see the sun.   <span class="verse">12</span> For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.  <span class="verse">13</span> Consider the work of God, for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?   <span class="verse">14</span> In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything after him.

He stayed there with them and baptized.   <span class="verse">23</span> John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came, and were baptized;   <span class="verse">24</span> for John was not yet thrown into prison.   <span class="verse">25</span> Therefore a dispute arose on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews about purification.   <span class="verse">26</span> They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, behold, he baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.”  <span class="verse">27</span> John answered, “A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven.   <span class="verse">28</span> You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’   <span class="verse">29</span> He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice. This, my joy, therefore is made full.   <span class="verse">30</span> He must increase, but I must decrease.   <span class="verse">31</span> He who comes from above is above all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.   <span class="verse">32</span> What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.   <span class="verse">33</span> He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.   <span class="verse">34</span> For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.   <span class="verse">35</span> The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.   <span class="verse">36</span> One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys   the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”
