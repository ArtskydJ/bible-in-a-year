		<span class="reference">Lamentations 3</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> I am the man who has seen affliction  by the rod of his wrath.  <span class="verse">2</span> He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness,  and not in light.  <span class="verse">3</span> Surely he turns his hand against me  again and again all day long.  <span class="verse">4</span> He has made my flesh and my skin old.  He has broken my bones.  <span class="verse">5</span> He has built against me,  and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.  <span class="verse">6</span> He has made me dwell in dark places,  as those who have been long dead.  <span class="verse">7</span> He has walled me about, so that I can’t go out.  He has made my chain heavy.  <span class="verse">8</span> Yes, when I cry, and call for help,  he shuts out my prayer.  <span class="verse">9</span> He has walled up my ways with cut stone.  He has made my paths crooked.  <span class="verse">10</span> He is to me as a bear lying in wait,  as a lion in secret places.  <span class="verse">11</span> He has turned away my ways,  and pulled me in pieces.  He has made me desolate.  <span class="verse">12</span> He has bent his bow,  and set me as a mark for the arrow.  <span class="verse">13</span> He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.  <span class="verse">14</span> I have become a derision to all my people,  and their song all day long.  <span class="verse">15</span> He has filled me with bitterness.  He has stuffed me with wormwood.  <span class="verse">16</span> He has also broken my teeth with gravel.  He has covered me with ashes.  <span class="verse">17</span> You have removed my soul far away from peace.  I forgot prosperity.  <span class="verse">18</span> I said, “My strength has perished,  along with my expectation from Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Remember my affliction and my misery,  the wormwood and the bitterness.  <span class="verse">20</span> My soul still remembers them,  and is bowed down within me.  <span class="verse">21</span> This I recall to my mind;  therefore I have hope.  <span class="verse">22</span> It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed,  because his compassion doesn’t fail.  <span class="verse">23</span> They are new every morning.  Great is your faithfulness.  <span class="verse">24</span> “Yahweh is my portion,” says my soul.  “Therefore I will hope in him.”  <span class="verse">25</span> Yahweh is good to those who wait for him,  to the soul who seeks him.  <span class="verse">26</span> It is good that a man should hope  and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.  <span class="verse">27</span> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.  <span class="verse">28</span> Let him sit alone and keep silence,  because he has laid it on him.  <span class="verse">29</span> Let him put his mouth in the dust,  if it is so that there may be hope.  <span class="verse">30</span> Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him.  Let him be filled full of reproach.  <span class="verse">31</span> For the Lord will not cast off forever.  <span class="verse">32</span> For though he causes grief,  yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.  <span class="verse">33</span> For he does not afflict willingly,  nor grieve the children of men.  <span class="verse">34</span> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,  <span class="verse">35</span> to turn away the right of a man before the face of the Most High,  <span class="verse">36</span> to subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.  <span class="verse">37</span> Who is he who says, and it comes to pass,  when the Lord doesn’t command it?  <span class="verse">38</span> Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?  <span class="verse">39</span> Why does a living man complain,  a man for the punishment of his sins?  <span class="verse">40</span> Let us search and try our ways,  and turn again to Yahweh.  <span class="verse">41</span> Let’s lift up our heart with our hands to God  in the heavens.  <span class="verse">42</span> “We have transgressed and have rebelled.  You have not pardoned.  <span class="verse">43</span> “You have covered us with anger and pursued us.  You have killed.  You have not pitied.  <span class="verse">44</span> You have covered yourself with a cloud,  so that no prayer can pass through.  <span class="verse">45</span> You have made us an off-scouring and refuse  in the middle of the peoples.  <span class="verse">46</span> “All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.  <span class="verse">47</span> Terror and the pit have come on us,  devastation and destruction.”  <span class="verse">48</span> My eye runs down with streams of water,  for the destruction of the daughter of my people.  <span class="verse">49</span> My eye pours down  and doesn’t cease,  without any intermission,  <span class="verse">50</span> until Yahweh looks down,  and sees from heaven.  <span class="verse">51</span> My eye affects my soul,  because of all the daughters of my city.  <span class="verse">52</span> They have chased me relentlessly like a bird,  those who are my enemies without cause.  <span class="verse">53</span> They have cut off my life in the dungeon,  and have cast a stone on me.  <span class="verse">54</span> Waters flowed over my head.  I said, “I am cut off.”  <span class="verse">55</span> I called on your name, Yahweh,  out of the lowest dungeon.  <span class="verse">56</span> You heard my voice:  “Don’t hide your ear from my sighing,  and my cry.”  <span class="verse">57</span> You came near in the day that I called on you.  You said, “Don’t be afraid.”  <span class="verse">58</span> Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul.  You have redeemed my life.  <span class="verse">59</span> Yahweh, you have seen my wrong.  Judge my cause.  <span class="verse">60</span> You have seen all their vengeance  and all their plans against me.  <span class="verse">61</span> You have heard their reproach, Yahweh,  and all their plans against me,  <span class="verse">62</span> the lips of those that rose up against me,  and their plots against me all day long.  <span class="verse">63</span> You see their sitting down and their rising up.  I am their song.  <span class="verse">64</span> You will pay them back, Yahweh,  according to the work of their hands.  <span class="verse">65</span> You will give them hardness of heart,  your curse to them.  <span class="verse">66</span> You will pursue them in anger,  and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.

If I found you outside, I would kiss you;  yes, and no one would despise me.  <span class="verse">2</span> I would lead you, bringing you into the house of my mother,  who would instruct me.  I would have you drink spiced wine,  of the juice of my pomegranate.  <span class="verse">3</span> His left hand would be under my head.  His right hand would embrace me.  <span class="verse">4</span> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,  that you not stir up, nor awaken love,  until it so desires.  <span class="verse">5</span> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness,  leaning on her beloved?  Under the apple tree I aroused you.  There your mother conceived you.  There she was in labor and bore you.  <span class="verse">6</span> Set me as a seal on your heart,  as a seal on your arm;  for love is strong as death.  Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol. Its flashes are flashes of fire,  a very flame of Yahweh. <span class="verse">7</span> Many waters can’t quench love,  neither can floods drown it.  If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,  he would be utterly scorned.

Why do you seek to kill me?” <span class="verse">20</span> The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”  <span class="verse">21</span> Jesus answered them,  “I did one work and you all marvel because of it.  <span class="verse">22</span> Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.  <span class="verse">23</span> If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?  <span class="verse">24</span> Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”

		<span class="reference">1 Peter 5:1-7</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.   <span class="verse">2</span> Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;   <span class="verse">3</span> not as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.   <span class="verse">4</span> When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.  <span class="verse">5</span> Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” <span class="verse">6</span> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,   <span class="verse">7</span> casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.
