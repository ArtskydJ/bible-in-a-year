		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 48</span>  <span class="chapter">48</span><span class="verse">1</span> Of Moab. Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says:  “Woe to Nebo!  For it is laid waste.  Kiriathaim is disappointed.  It is taken.  Misgab  is put to shame  and broken down.  <span class="verse">2</span> The praise of Moab is no more.  In Heshbon they have devised evil against her:  ‘Come! Let’s cut her off from being a nation.’  You also, Madmen, will be brought to silence.  The sword will pursue you.  <span class="verse">3</span> The sound of a cry from Horonaim,  desolation and great destruction!  <span class="verse">4</span> Moab is destroyed.  Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.  <span class="verse">5</span> For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping.  For at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.  <span class="verse">6</span> Flee! Save your lives!  Be like the juniper bush in the wilderness.  <span class="verse">7</span> For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures,  you also will be taken.  Chemosh will go out into captivity,  his priests and his princes together.  <span class="verse">8</span> The destroyer will come on every city,  and no city will escape;  the valley also will perish,  and the plain will be destroyed; as Yahweh has spoken.  <span class="verse">9</span> Give wings to Moab,  that she may fly and get herself away:  and her cities will become a desolation,  without anyone to dwell in them.  <span class="verse">10</span> “Cursed is he who does the work of Yahweh negligently;  and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood.  <span class="verse">11</span> “Moab has been at ease from his youth,  and he has settled on his lees,  and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,  neither has he gone into captivity:  therefore his taste remains in him,  and his scent is not changed.  <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh,  “that I will send to him those who pour off,  and they will pour him off;  and they will empty his vessels,  and break their containers in pieces.  <span class="verse">13</span> Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,  as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.  <span class="verse">14</span> “How do you say, ‘We are mighty men,  and valiant men for the war?’  <span class="verse">15</span> Moab is laid waste,  and they have gone up into his cities,  and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter,”  says the King, whose name is Yahweh of Armies.  <span class="verse">16</span> “The calamity of Moab is near to come,  and his affliction hurries fast.  <span class="verse">17</span> All you who are around him, bemoan him,  and all you who know his name; say,  ‘How the strong staff is broken,  the beautiful rod!’  <span class="verse">18</span> “You daughter who dwells in Dibon,  come down from your glory,  and sit in thirst;  for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you.  He has destroyed your strongholds.  <span class="verse">19</span> Inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch.  Ask him who flees, and her who escapes;  say, ‘What has been done?’  <span class="verse">20</span> Moab is disappointed;  for it is broken down.  Wail and cry!  Tell it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.  <span class="verse">21</span> Judgment has come on the plain country,  on Holon, on Jahzah, on Mephaath,  <span class="verse">22</span> on Dibon, on Nebo, on Beth Diblathaim,  <span class="verse">23</span> on Kiriathaim, on Beth Gamul, on Beth Meon,  <span class="verse">24</span> on Kerioth, on Bozrah,  and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.  <span class="verse">25</span> The horn of Moab is cut off,  and his arm is broken,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">26</span> “Make him drunken;  for he magnified himself against Yahweh.  Moab will wallow in his vomit,  and he also will be in derision.  <span class="verse">27</span> For wasn’t Israel a derision to you?  Was he found among thieves?  For as often as you speak of him,  you shake your head.  <span class="verse">28</span> You inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock.  Be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.  <span class="verse">29</span> “We have heard of the pride of Moab.  He is very proud in his loftiness, his pride,  his arrogance, and the arrogance of his heart.  <span class="verse">30</span> I know his wrath,” says Yahweh, “that it is nothing;  his boastings have done nothing.  <span class="verse">31</span> Therefore I will wail for Moab.  Yes, I will cry out for all Moab.  They will mourn for the men of Kir Heres.  <span class="verse">32</span> With more than the weeping of Jazer  I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah.  Your branches passed over the sea.  They reached even to the sea of Jazer.  The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits  and on your vintage.  <span class="verse">33</span> Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field  and from the land of Moab.  I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses.  No one will tread with shouting.  The shouting will be no shouting.  <span class="verse">34</span> From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh,  even to Jahaz they have uttered their voice,  from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath Shelishiyah;  for the waters of Nimrim will also become desolate.  <span class="verse">35</span> Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,” says Yahweh,  “him who offers in the high place,  and him who burns incense to his gods.  <span class="verse">36</span> Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes,  and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres.  Therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.  <span class="verse">37</span> For every head is bald,  and every beard clipped.  There are cuttings on all the hands,  and sackcloth on the waist.  <span class="verse">38</span> On all the housetops of Moab,  and in its streets, there is lamentation everywhere;  for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which no one delights,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">39</span> “How it is broken down!  How they wail!  How Moab has turned the back with shame!  So will Moab become a derision  and a terror to all who are around him.”  <span class="verse">40</span> For Yahweh says: “Behold, he will fly as an eagle,  and will spread out his wings against Moab.  <span class="verse">41</span> Kerioth is taken,  and the strongholds are seized.  The heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day  will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.  <span class="verse">42</span> Moab will be destroyed from being a people,  because he has magnified himself against Yahweh.  <span class="verse">43</span> Terror, the pit, and the snare are on you,  inhabitant of Moab,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">44</span> “He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit;  and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare:  for I will bring on him, even on Moab,  the year of their visitation,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">45</span> “Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;  for a fire has gone out of Heshbon,  and a flame from the middle of Sihon,  and has devoured the corner of Moab,  and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.  <span class="verse">46</span> Woe to you, O Moab!  The people of Chemosh are undone;  for your sons are taken away captive,  and your daughters into captivity.  <span class="verse">47</span> “Yet I will reverse the captivity of Moab in the latter days,”  says Yahweh.  Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

I sought him, but I didn’t find him.  <span class="verse">2</span> I will get up now, and go about the city;  in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves.  I sought him, but I didn’t find him.  <span class="verse">3</span> The watchmen who go about the city found me;  “Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”  <span class="verse">4</span> I had scarcely passed from them,  when I found him whom my soul loves.  I held him, and would not let him go,  until I had brought him into my mother’s house,  into the room of her who conceived me.  <span class="verse">5</span> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,  by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,  that you not stir up nor awaken love,  until it so desires.  <span class="verse">6</span> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke,  perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,  with all spices of the merchant?  <span class="verse">7</span> Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage!  Sixty mighty men are around it,  of the mighty men of Israel.  <span class="verse">8</span> They all handle the sword, and are expert in war.  Every man has his sword on his thigh,  because of fear in the night.  <span class="verse">9</span> King Solomon made himself a carriage  of the wood of Lebanon.  <span class="verse">10</span> He made its pillars of silver,  its bottom of gold, its seat of purple,  the middle of it being paved with love,  from the daughters of Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">11</span> Go out, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon,  with the crown with which his mother has crowned him,  in the day of his weddings,  in the day of the gladness of his heart.

It was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.   <span class="verse">18</span> The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.   <span class="verse">19</span> When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia,   they saw Jesus walking on the sea,  and drawing near to the boat; and they were afraid.   <span class="verse">20</span> But he said to them,  “It is I. Don’t be afraid.” <span class="verse">21</span> They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.  <span class="verse">22</span> On the next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that Jesus hadn’t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had gone away alone.   <span class="verse">23</span> However boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.   <span class="verse">24</span> When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
