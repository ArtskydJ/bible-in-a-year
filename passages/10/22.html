		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 45-47</span>  <span class="chapter">45</span><span class="verse">1</span> The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:   <span class="verse">3</span> ‘You said, “Woe is me now! For Yahweh has added sorrow to my pain! I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.” ’  <span class="verse">4</span> “You shall tell him, Yahweh says: ‘Behold, that which I have built, I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land.   <span class="verse">5</span> Do you seek great things for yourself? Don’t seek them; for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh,’ says Yahweh; ‘but I will let you escape with your life wherever you go.’ ”   <span class="chapter">46</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word which came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.  <span class="verse">2</span> Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah.  <span class="verse">3</span> “Prepare the buckler and shield,  and draw near to battle!  <span class="verse">4</span> Harness the horses, and get up, you horsemen,  and stand up with your helmets.  Polish the spears,  put on the coats of mail.  <span class="verse">5</span> Why have I seen it?  They are dismayed and are turned backward.  Their mighty ones are beaten down,  have fled in haste,  and don’t look back.  Terror is on every side,”  says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">6</span> “Don’t let the swift flee away,  nor the mighty man escape.  In the north by the river Euphrates  they have stumbled and fallen.  <span class="verse">7</span> “Who is this who rises up like the Nile,  whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?  <span class="verse">8</span> Egypt rises up like the Nile,  and his waters toss themselves like the rivers.  He says, ‘I will rise up. I will cover the earth.  I will destroy cities and its inhabitants.’  <span class="verse">9</span> Go up, you horses!  Rage, you chariots!  Let the mighty men go out:  Cush and Put, who handle the shield;  and the Ludim, who handle and bend the bow.  <span class="verse">10</span> For that day is of the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,  a day of vengeance,  that he may avenge himself of his adversaries.  The sword will devour and be satiated,  and will drink its fill of their blood;  for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.  <span class="verse">11</span> Go up into Gilead, and take balm, virgin daughter of Egypt.  You use many medicines in vain.  There is no healing for you.  <span class="verse">12</span> The nations have heard of your shame,  and the earth is full of your cry;  for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty,  they both fall together.”  <span class="verse">13</span> The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt.  <span class="verse">14</span> “Declare in Egypt,  publish in Migdol,  and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes:  say, ‘Stand up, and prepare;  for the sword has devoured around you.’  <span class="verse">15</span> Why are your strong ones swept away?  They didn’t stand, because Yahweh pushed them.  <span class="verse">16</span> He made many to stumble.  Yes, they fell on one another.  They said, ‘Arise! Let’s go again to our own people,  and to the land of our birth,  from the oppressing sword.’  <span class="verse">17</span> They cried there, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise;  he has let the appointed time pass by.’  <span class="verse">18</span> “As I live,” says the King,  whose name is Yahweh of Armies,  “surely like Tabor among the mountains,  and like Carmel by the sea,  so he will come.  <span class="verse">19</span> You daughter who dwells in Egypt,  furnish yourself to go into captivity;  for Memphis will become a desolation,  and will be burned up,  without inhabitant.  <span class="verse">20</span> “Egypt is a very beautiful heifer;  but destruction out of the north has come.  It has come.  <span class="verse">21</span> Also her hired men in the middle of her are like calves of the stall;  for they also are turned back.  They have fled away together.  They didn’t stand,  for the day of their calamity has come on them,  the time of their visitation.  <span class="verse">22</span> Its sound will go like the serpent;  for they will march with an army,  and come against her with axes, as wood cutters.  <span class="verse">23</span> They will cut down her forest,” says Yahweh,  “though it can’t be searched;  because they are more than the locusts,  and are innumerable.  <span class="verse">24</span> The daughter of Egypt will be disappointed;  she will be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.”  <span class="verse">25</span> Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods, and her kings; even Pharaoh, and those who trust in him.   <span class="verse">26</span> I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants. Afterwards it will be inhabited, as in the days of old,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">27</span> “But don’t you be afraid, Jacob my servant.  Don’t be dismayed, Israel;  for, behold, I will save you from afar,  and your offspring from the land of their captivity.  Jacob will return,  and will be quiet and at ease.  No one will make him afraid.  <span class="verse">28</span> Don’t be afraid, O Jacob my servant,” says Yahweh;  “for I am with you;  for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you;  but I will not make a full end of you,  but I will correct you in measure,  and will in no way leave you unpunished.”   <span class="chapter">47</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh struck Gaza.  <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh says:  “Behold, waters rise up out of the north,  and will become an overflowing stream,  and will overflow the land and all that is therein,  the city and those who dwell therein.  The men will cry,  and all the inhabitants of the land will wail.  <span class="verse">3</span> At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones,  at the rushing of his chariots,  at the rumbling of his wheels,  the fathers don’t look back to their children  for feebleness of hands;  <span class="verse">4</span> because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines,  to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains;  for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines,  the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.  <span class="verse">5</span> Baldness has come on Gaza;  Ashkelon is brought to nothing,  the remnant of their valley:  how long will you cut yourself?  <span class="verse">6</span> “ ‘You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you are quiet?  Put yourself back into your scabbard;  rest, and be still.’  <span class="verse">7</span> “How can you be quiet,  since Yahweh has given you a command?  Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore,  there has he appointed it.”

I sat down under his shadow with great delight,  his fruit was sweet to my taste.  <span class="verse">4</span> He brought me to the banquet hall.  His banner over me is love.  <span class="verse">5</span> Strengthen me with raisins,  refresh me with apples;  for I am faint with love.  <span class="verse">6</span> His left hand is under my head.  His right hand embraces me.  <span class="verse">7</span> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,  by the roes, or by the hinds of the field,  that you not stir up, nor awaken love,  until it so desires.  <span class="verse">8</span> The voice of my beloved!  Behold, he comes,  leaping on the mountains,  skipping on the hills.  <span class="verse">9</span> My beloved is like a roe or a young deer.  Behold, he stands behind our wall!  He looks in at the windows.  He glances through the lattice.  <span class="verse">10</span> My beloved spoke, and said to me,  “Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.  <span class="verse">11</span> For behold, the winter is past.  The rain is over and gone.  <span class="verse">12</span> The flowers appear on the earth.  The time of the singing has come,  and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.  <span class="verse">13</span> The fig tree ripens her green figs.  The vines are in blossom.  They give out their fragrance.  Arise, my love, my beautiful one,  and come away.”  <span class="verse">14</span> My dove in the clefts of the rock,  in the hiding places of the mountainside,  let me see your face.  let me hear your voice;  for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely.  <span class="verse">15</span> Catch for us the foxes,  the little foxes that plunder the vineyards;  for our vineyards are in blossom.  <span class="verse">16</span> My beloved is mine, and I am his.  He browses among the lilies.  <span class="verse">17</span> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,  turn, my beloved,  and be like a roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether.

So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.   <span class="verse">11</span> Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down; likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.   <span class="verse">12</span> When they were filled, he said to his disciples,  “Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that nothing be lost.” <span class="verse">13</span> So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten.   <span class="verse">14</span> When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.”   <span class="verse">15</span> Jesus therefore, perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.

But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.   <span class="verse">21</span> For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you  an example, that you should follow his steps,   <span class="verse">22</span> who didn’t sin, “neither was deceit found in his mouth.” <span class="verse">23</span> When he was cursed, he didn’t curse back. When he suffered, he didn’t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously.   <span class="verse">24</span> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness.
