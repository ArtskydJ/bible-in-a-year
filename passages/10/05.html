		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 10-11</span>  <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you, house of Israel!   <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh says,  “Don’t learn the way of the nations,  and don’t be dismayed at the signs of the sky;  for the nations are dismayed at them.  <span class="verse">3</span> For the customs of the peoples are vanity;  for one cuts a tree out of the forest,  the work of the hands of the workman with the ax.  <span class="verse">4</span> They deck it with silver and with gold.  They fasten it with nails and with hammers,  so that it can’t move.  <span class="verse">5</span> They are like a palm tree, of turned work,  and don’t speak.  They must be carried,  because they can’t move.  Don’t be afraid of them;  for they can’t do evil,  neither is it in them to do good.”  <span class="verse">6</span> There is no one like you, Yahweh.  You are great,  and your name is great in might.  <span class="verse">7</span> Who shouldn’t fear you,  King of the nations?  For it belongs to you.  Because among all the wise men of the nations,  and in all their royal estate,  there is no one like you.  <span class="verse">8</span> But they are together brutish and foolish,  instructed by idols!  It is just wood.  <span class="verse">9</span> There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish,  and gold from Uphaz,  the work of the engraver and of the hands of the goldsmith.  Their clothing is blue and purple.  They are all the work of skillful men.  <span class="verse">10</span> But Yahweh is the true God.  He is the living God,  and an everlasting King.  At his wrath, the earth trembles.  The nations aren’t able to withstand his indignation.  <span class="verse">11</span> “You shall say this to them: ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.’ ”  <span class="verse">12</span> God has made the earth by his power.  He has established the world by his wisdom,  and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens.  <span class="verse">13</span> When he utters his voice,  the waters in the heavens roar,  and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.  He makes lightnings for the rain,  and brings the wind out of his treasuries.  <span class="verse">14</span> Every man has become brutish and without knowledge.  Every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image;  for his molten image is falsehood,  and there is no breath in them.  <span class="verse">15</span> They are vanity, a work of delusion.  In the time of their visitation they will perish.  <span class="verse">16</span> The portion of Jacob is not like these;  for he is the maker of all things;  and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance:  Yahweh of Armies is his name.  <span class="verse">17</span> Gather up your wares out of the land,  you who live under siege.  <span class="verse">18</span> For Yahweh says,  “Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time,  and will distress them, that they may feel it.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Woe is me because of my injury!  My wound is serious;  but I said,  “Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.”  <span class="verse">20</span> My tent has been destroyed,  and all my cords are broken.  My children have gone away from me, and they are no more.  There is no one to spread my tent any more,  to set up my curtains.  <span class="verse">21</span> For the shepherds have become brutish,  and have not inquired of Yahweh.  Therefore they have not prospered,  and all their flocks have scattered.  <span class="verse">22</span> The voice of news, behold, it comes,  and a great commotion out of the north country,  to make the cities of Judah a desolation,  a dwelling place of jackals.  <span class="verse">23</span> Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself.  It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.  <span class="verse">24</span> Yahweh, correct me, but gently;  not in your anger,  lest you reduce me to nothing.  <span class="verse">25</span> Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,  and on the families that don’t call on your name;  for they have devoured Jacob.  Yes, they have devoured him, consumed him,  and have laid waste his habitation.   <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;   <span class="verse">3</span> and say to them, Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Cursed is the man who doesn’t hear the words of this covenant,   <span class="verse">4</span> which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace,’ saying, ‘Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you; so you shall be my people, and I will be your God;   <span class="verse">5</span> that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as it is today.”  Then I answered, and said, “Amen, Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant, and do them.   <span class="verse">7</span> For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, “Obey my voice.”   <span class="verse">8</span> Yet they didn’t obey, nor turn their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart. Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn’t do them.’ ”  <span class="verse">9</span> Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">10</span> They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.   <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they will not be able to escape; and they will cry to me, but I will not listen to them.   <span class="verse">12</span> Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.   <span class="verse">13</span> For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.’  <span class="verse">14</span> “Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.  <span class="verse">15</span> What has my beloved to do in my house,  since she has behaved lewdly with many,  and the holy flesh has passed from you?  When you do evil,  then you rejoice.”  <span class="verse">16</span> Yahweh called your name, “A green olive tree,  beautiful with goodly fruit.”  With the noise of a great roar he has kindled fire on it,  and its branches are broken.  <span class="verse">17</span> For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.  <span class="verse">18</span> Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it. Then you showed me their doings.   <span class="verse">19</span> But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plans against me, saying,  “Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit,  and let’s cut him off from the land of the living,  that his name may be no more remembered.”  <span class="verse">20</span> But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously,  who tests the heart and the mind,  I will see your vengeance on them;  for to you I have revealed my cause.  <span class="verse">21</span> “Therefore Yahweh says concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, ‘You shall not prophesy in Yahweh’s name, that you not die by our hand;’   <span class="verse">22</span> therefore Yahweh of Armies says, ‘Behold, I will punish them. The young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by famine.   <span class="verse">23</span> There will be no remnant to them, for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.’ ”

He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can’t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end.   <span class="verse">12</span> I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live.   <span class="verse">13</span> Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.   <span class="verse">14</span> I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God has done it, that men should fear before him.   <span class="verse">15</span> That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has been long ago. God seeks again that which is passed away.
