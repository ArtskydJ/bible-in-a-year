		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 12-13</span>  <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> You are righteous, Yahweh,  when I contend with you;  yet I would like to reason the cause with you.  Why does the way of the wicked prosper?  Why are they all at ease who deal very treacherously?  <span class="verse">2</span> You have planted them. Yes, they have taken root.  They grow. Yes, they produce fruit.  You are near in their mouth,  and far from their heart.  <span class="verse">3</span> But you, Yahweh, know me.  You see me, and test my heart toward you.  Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,  and prepare them for the day of slaughter.  <span class="verse">4</span> How long will the land mourn,  and the herbs of the whole country wither?  Because of the wickedness of those who dwell therein,  the animals and birds are consumed;  because they said,  “He won’t see our latter end.”  <span class="verse">5</span> “If you have run with the footmen,  and they have wearied you,  then how can you contend with horses?  Though in a land of peace you are secure,  yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?  <span class="verse">6</span> For even your brothers, and the house of your father,  even they have dealt treacherously with you!  Even they have cried aloud after you!  Don’t believe them,  though they speak beautiful words to you.  <span class="verse">7</span> “I have forsaken my house.  I have cast off my heritage.  I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.  <span class="verse">8</span> My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest.  She has uttered her voice against me.  Therefore I have hated her.  <span class="verse">9</span> Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey?  Are the birds of prey against her all around?  Go, assemble all the animals of the field.  Bring them to devour.  <span class="verse">10</span> Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard.  They have trodden my portion under foot.  They have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.  <span class="verse">11</span> They have made it a desolation.  It mourns to me, being desolate.  The whole land is made desolate,  because no one cares.  <span class="verse">12</span> Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness;  for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land.  No flesh has peace.  <span class="verse">13</span> They have sown wheat,  and have reaped thorns.  They have exhausted themselves,  and profit nothing.  You will be ashamed of your fruits,  because of Yahweh’s fierce anger.”  <span class="verse">14</span> Yahweh says, “Concerning all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.   <span class="verse">15</span> It will happen that after I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them. I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.   <span class="verse">16</span> It will happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, ‘As Yahweh lives;’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be built up in the middle of my people.   <span class="verse">17</span> But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it,” says Yahweh.   <span class="chapter">13</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh said to me, “Go, and buy yourself a linen belt, and put it on your waist, and don’t put it in water.”  <span class="verse">2</span> So I bought a belt according to Yahweh’s word, and put it on my waist.  <span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying,   <span class="verse">4</span> “Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.”  <span class="verse">5</span> So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me.  <span class="verse">6</span> After many days, Yahweh said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which I commanded you to hide there.”  <span class="verse">7</span> Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was ruined. It was profitable for nothing.  <span class="verse">8</span> Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying,   <span class="verse">9</span> “Yahweh says, ‘In this way I, will ruin the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">10</span> This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, will even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing.   <span class="verse">11</span> For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to me,’ says Yahweh; ‘that they may be to me for a people, for a name, for praise, and for glory; but they would not hear.’  <span class="verse">12</span> “Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says, “Every container should be filled with wine.” ’ They will tell you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every container should be filled with wine?’   <span class="verse">13</span> Then tell them, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.   <span class="verse">14</span> I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together,” says Yahweh: “I will not pity, spare, or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.” ’ ”  <span class="verse">15</span> Hear, and give ear.  Don’t be proud,  for Yahweh has spoken.  <span class="verse">16</span> Give glory to Yahweh your God,  before he causes darkness,  and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains,  and while you look for light,  he turns it into the shadow of death,  and makes it deep darkness.  <span class="verse">17</span> But if you will not hear it,  my soul will weep in secret for your pride.  My eye will weep bitterly,  and run down with tears,  because Yahweh’s flock has been taken captive.  <span class="verse">18</span> Say to the king and to the queen mother,  “Humble yourselves.  Sit down, for your crowns have come down,  even the crown of your glory.  <span class="verse">19</span> The cities of the South are shut up,  and there is no one to open them.  Judah is carried away captive: all of them.  They are wholly carried away captive.  <span class="verse">20</span> Lift up your eyes,  and see those who come from the north.  Where is the flock that was given to you,  your beautiful flock?  <span class="verse">21</span> What will you say, when he sets over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you?  Won’t sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?  <span class="verse">22</span> If you say in your heart,  “Why have these things come on me?”  Your skirts are uncovered because of the greatness of your iniquity,  and your heels suffer violence.  <span class="verse">23</span> Can the Ethiopian change his skin,  or the leopard his spots?  Then may you also do good,  who are accustomed to do evil.  <span class="verse">24</span> “Therefore I will scatter them,  as the stubble that passes away,  by the wind of the wilderness.  <span class="verse">25</span> This is your lot,  the portion measured to you from me,” says Yahweh,  “because you have forgotten me,  and trusted in falsehood.”  <span class="verse">26</span> Therefore I will also uncover your skirts on your face,  and your shame will appear.  <span class="verse">27</span> I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries,  and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution,  on the hills in the field.  Woe to you, Jerusalem!  You will not be made clean.  How long will it yet be?”

Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals; for all is vanity.   <span class="verse">20</span> All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.   <span class="verse">21</span> Who knows the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal, whether it goes downward to the earth?”  <span class="verse">22</span> Therefore I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who can bring him to see what will be after him?

Jesus said to him,  “Follow me.” <span class="verse">44</span> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.   <span class="verse">45</span> Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”  <span class="verse">46</span> Nathanael said to him, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?”  Philip said to him, “Come and see.”  <span class="verse">47</span> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him,  “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!” <span class="verse">48</span> Nathanael said to him, “How do you know me?”  Jesus answered him,  “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” <span class="verse">49</span> Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”  <span class="verse">50</span> Jesus answered him,  “Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!” <span class="verse">51</span> He said to him,  “Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”

		<span class="reference">James 2:14-26</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">14</span> What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him?   <span class="verse">15</span> And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,   <span class="verse">16</span> and one of you tells them, “Go in peace. Be warmed and filled;” yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it?   <span class="verse">17</span> Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself.   <span class="verse">18</span> Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.  <span class="verse">19</span> You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder.   <span class="verse">20</span> But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead?   <span class="verse">21</span> Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?   <span class="verse">22</span> You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected.   <span class="verse">23</span> So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness,”  and he was called the friend of God.   <span class="verse">24</span> You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith.   <span class="verse">25</span> In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers and sent them out another way?   <span class="verse">26</span> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
