		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 14-15</span>  <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> This is Yahweh’s word that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.  <span class="verse">2</span> “Judah mourns,  and its gates languish.  They sit in black on the ground.  The cry of Jerusalem goes up.  <span class="verse">3</span> Their nobles send their little ones to the waters.  They come to the cisterns,  and find no water.  They return with their vessels empty.  They are disappointed and confounded,  and cover their heads.  <span class="verse">4</span> Because of the ground which is cracked,  because no rain has been in the land,  the plowmen are disappointed.  They cover their heads.  <span class="verse">5</span> Yes, the doe in the field also calves and forsakes her young,  because there is no grass.  <span class="verse">6</span> The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights.  They pant for air like jackals.  Their eyes fail,  because there is no vegetation.  <span class="verse">7</span> Though our iniquities testify against us,  work for your name’s sake, Yahweh;  for our rebellions are many.  We have sinned against you.  <span class="verse">8</span> You hope of Israel,  its Savior in the time of trouble,  why should you be as a foreigner in the land,  and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?  <span class="verse">9</span> Why should you be like a scared man,  as a mighty man who can’t save?  Yet you, Yahweh, are in the middle of us,  and we are called by your name.  Don’t leave us.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh says to this people,  “Even so they have loved to wander.  They have not restrained their feet.  Therefore Yahweh does not accept them.  Now he will remember their iniquity,  and punish them for their sins.”  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said to me, “Don’t pray for this people for their good.   <span class="verse">12</span> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh! Behold, the prophets tell them, ‘You will not see the sword, neither will you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.’ ”  <span class="verse">14</span> Then Yahweh said to me, “The prophets prophesy lies in my name. I didn’t send them. I didn’t command them. I didn’t speak to them. They prophesy to you a lying vision, divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.   <span class="verse">15</span> Therefore Yahweh says concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, but I didn’t send them, yet they say, ‘Sword and famine will not be in this land.’ Those prophets will be consumed by sword and famine.   <span class="verse">16</span> The people to whom they prophesy will be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. They will have no one to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters, for I will pour their wickedness on them.  <span class="verse">17</span> “You shall say this word to them:  “ ‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day,  and let them not cease;  for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach,  with a very grievous wound.  <span class="verse">18</span> If I go out into the field,  then, behold, the slain with the sword!  If I enter into the city,  then, behold, those who are sick with famine!  For both the prophet and the priest go about in the land,  and have no knowledge.’ ”  <span class="verse">19</span> Have you utterly rejected Judah?  Has your soul loathed Zion?  Why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us?  We looked for peace, but no good came;  and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!  <span class="verse">20</span> We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness,  and the iniquity of our fathers;  for we have sinned against you.  <span class="verse">21</span> Do not abhor us, for your name’s sake.  Do not disgrace the throne of your glory.  Remember, and don’t break your covenant with us.  <span class="verse">22</span> Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain?  Or can the sky give showers?  Aren’t you he, Yahweh our God?  Therefore we will wait for you;  for you have made all these things.   <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Yahweh said to me, “Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind would not turn toward this people. Cast them out of my sight, and let them go out!   <span class="verse">2</span> It will happen, when they ask you, ‘Where shall we go out?’ then you shall tell them, ‘Yahweh says:  “Such as are for death, to death;  such as are for the sword, to the sword;  such as are for the famine, to the famine;  and such as are for captivity, to captivity.” ’  <span class="verse">3</span> “I will appoint over them four kinds,” says Yahweh: “the sword to kill, the dogs to tear, the birds of the sky, and the animals of the earth, to devour and to destroy.   <span class="verse">4</span> I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">5</span> For who will have pity on you, Jerusalem?  Who will mourn you?  Who will come to ask of your welfare?  <span class="verse">6</span> You have rejected me,” says Yahweh.  “You have gone backward.  Therefore I have stretched out my hand against you  and destroyed you.  I am weary of showing compassion.  <span class="verse">7</span> I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land.  I have bereaved them of children.  I have destroyed my people.  They didn’t return from their ways.  <span class="verse">8</span> Their widows are increased more than the sand of the seas.  I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday.  I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly.  <span class="verse">9</span> She who has borne seven languishes.  She has given up the spirit.  Her sun has gone down while it was yet day.  She has been disappointed and confounded.  I will deliver their residue to the sword before their enemies,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">10</span> Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me, a man of strife,  and a man of contention to the whole earth!  I have not lent, neither have men lent to me;  yet every one of them curses me.  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh said,  “Most certainly I will strengthen you for good.  Most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil  and in the time of affliction.  <span class="verse">12</span> Can one break iron,  even iron from the north, and bronze?  <span class="verse">13</span> I will give your substance and your treasures for a plunder without price,  and that for all your sins,  even in all your borders.  <span class="verse">14</span> I will make them to pass with your enemies into a land which you don’t know;  for a fire is kindled in my anger,  which will burn on you.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh, you know.  Remember me, visit me,  and avenge me of my persecutors.  You are patient, so don’t take me away.  Know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.  <span class="verse">16</span> Your words were found,  and I ate them.  Your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart,  for I am called by your name, Yahweh, God of Armies.  <span class="verse">17</span> I didn’t sit in the assembly of those who make merry and rejoice.  I sat alone because of your hand,  for you have filled me with indignation.  <span class="verse">18</span> Why is my pain perpetual,  and my wound incurable,  which refuses to be healed?  Will you indeed be to me as a deceitful brook,  like waters that fail?  <span class="verse">19</span> Therefore Yahweh says,  “If you return, then I will bring you again,  that you may stand before me;  and if you take out the precious from the vile,  you will be as my mouth.  They will return to you,  but you will not return to them.  <span class="verse">20</span> I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall.  They will fight against you,  but they will not prevail against you;  for I am with you to save you  and to deliver you,” says Yahweh.  <span class="verse">21</span> “I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked,  and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.”

		<span class="reference">Ecclesiastes 4</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.   <span class="verse">2</span> Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive.   <span class="verse">3</span> Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.   <span class="verse">4</span> Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man’s neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.  <span class="verse">5</span> The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.   <span class="verse">6</span> Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind.  <span class="verse">7</span> Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.   <span class="verse">8</span> There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. “For whom then, do I labor and deprive my soul of enjoyment?” This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business.  <span class="verse">9</span> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.   <span class="verse">10</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn’t have another to lift him up.   <span class="verse">11</span> Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?   <span class="verse">12</span> If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.  <span class="verse">13</span> Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn’t know how to receive admonition any more.   <span class="verse">14</span> For out of prison he came out to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.   <span class="verse">15</span> I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.   <span class="verse">16</span> There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was—yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.

Jesus’ mother was there.   <span class="verse">2</span> Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the wedding.   <span class="verse">3</span> When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Jesus said to her,  “Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.” <span class="verse">5</span> His mother said to the servants, “Whatever he says to you, do it.”   <span class="verse">6</span> Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or three metretes  apiece.   <span class="verse">7</span> Jesus said to them,  “Fill the water pots with water.”  So they filled them up to the brim.   <span class="verse">8</span> He said to them,  “Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast.”  So they took it.   <span class="verse">9</span> When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom   <span class="verse">10</span> and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!”   <span class="verse">11</span> This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.

		<span class="reference">James 3:1-6</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.   <span class="verse">2</span> For we all stumble in many things. Anyone who doesn’t stumble in word is a perfect person, able to bridle the whole body also.   <span class="verse">3</span> Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.   <span class="verse">4</span> Behold,  the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.   <span class="verse">5</span> So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!   <span class="verse">6</span> And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.
