		<span class="reference">Jeremiah 16-17</span>  <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh’s word came also to me, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters, in this place.”   <span class="verse">3</span> For Yahweh says concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land:   <span class="verse">4</span> “They will die grievous deaths. They will not be lamented, neither will they be buried. They will be as dung on the surface of the ground. They will be consumed by the sword and by famine. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.”  <span class="verse">5</span> For Yahweh says, “Don’t enter into the house of mourning. Don’t go to lament. Don’t bemoan them, for I have taken away my peace from this people,” says Yahweh, “even loving kindness and tender mercies.   <span class="verse">6</span> Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried. Men won’t lament for them, cut themselves, or make themselves bald for them.   <span class="verse">7</span> Men won’t break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead. Men won’t give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.  <span class="verse">8</span> “You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and to drink.”   <span class="verse">9</span> For Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.   <span class="verse">10</span> It will happen, when you tell this people all these words, and they ask you, ‘Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us?’ or ‘What is our iniquity? or ‘What is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?’   <span class="verse">11</span> then you shall tell them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,’ says Yahweh, ‘and have walked after other gods, have served them, have worshiped them, have forsaken me, and have not kept my law.   <span class="verse">12</span> You have done evil more than your fathers, for behold, you each walk after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you don’t listen to me.   <span class="verse">13</span> Therefore I will cast you out of this land into the land that you have not known, neither you nor your fathers. There you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’  <span class="verse">14</span> “Therefore behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that it will no more be said, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’   <span class="verse">15</span> but, ‘As Yahweh lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had driven them.’ I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.  <span class="verse">16</span> “Behold, I will send for many fishermen,” says Yahweh, “and they will fish them up. Afterward I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain, from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.   <span class="verse">17</span> For my eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from my face. Their iniquity isn’t concealed from my eyes.   <span class="verse">18</span> First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.”  <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold,  and my refuge in the day of affliction,  the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth,  and will say,  “Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies,  vanity and things in which there is no profit.  <span class="verse">20</span> Should a man make to himself gods  which yet are no gods?”  <span class="verse">21</span> “Therefore behold, I will cause them to know,  this once I will cause them to know my hand and my might.  Then they will know that my name is Yahweh.”   <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> “The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron,  and with the point of a diamond.  It is engraved on the tablet of their heart,  and on the horns of your altars.  <span class="verse">2</span> Even their children remember their altars  and their Asherah poles by the green trees on the high hills.  <span class="verse">3</span> My mountain in the field,  I will give your substance and all your treasures for a plunder,  and your high places, because of sin, throughout all your borders.  <span class="verse">4</span> You, even of yourself, will discontinue from your heritage that I gave you.  I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don’t know,  for you have kindled a fire in my anger which will burn forever.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Yahweh says:  “Cursed is the man who trusts in man,  relies on strength of flesh,  and whose heart departs from Yahweh.  <span class="verse">6</span> For he will be like a bush in the desert,  and will not see when good comes,  but will inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,  an uninhabited salt land.  <span class="verse">7</span> “Blessed is the man who trusts in Yahweh,  and whose confidence is in Yahweh.  <span class="verse">8</span> For he will be as a tree planted by the waters,  who spreads out its roots by the river,  and will not fear when heat comes,  but its leaf will be green,  and will not be concerned in the year of drought.  It won’t cease from yielding fruit.  <span class="verse">9</span> The heart is deceitful above all things  and it is exceedingly corrupt.  Who can know it?  <span class="verse">10</span> “I, Yahweh, search the mind.  I try the heart,  even to give every man according to his ways,  according to the fruit of his doings.”  <span class="verse">11</span> As the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid,  so is he who gets riches, and not by right.  In the middle of his days, they will leave him.  At his end, he will be a fool.  <span class="verse">12</span> A glorious throne, set on high from the beginning,  is the place of our sanctuary.  <span class="verse">13</span> Yahweh, the hope of Israel,  all who forsake you will be disappointed.  Those who depart from me will be written in the earth,  because they have forsaken Yahweh,  the spring of living waters.  <span class="verse">14</span> Heal me, O Yahweh, and I will be healed.  Save me, and I will be saved;  for you are my praise.  <span class="verse">15</span> Behold, they ask me,  “Where is Yahweh’s word?  Let it be fulfilled now.”  <span class="verse">16</span> As for me, I have not hurried from being a shepherd after you.  I haven’t desired the woeful day. You know.  That which came out of my lips was before your face.  <span class="verse">17</span> Don’t be a terror to me.  You are my refuge in the day of evil.  <span class="verse">18</span> Let them be disappointed who persecute me,  but let not me be disappointed.  Let them be dismayed,  but don’t let me be dismayed.  Bring on them the day of evil,  and destroy them with double destruction.  <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh said this to me: “Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, through which the kings of Judah come in and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">20</span> Tell them, ‘Hear Yahweh’s word, you kings of Judah, all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:   <span class="verse">21</span> Yahweh says, “Be careful, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">22</span> Don’t carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day. Don’t do any work, but make the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers.   <span class="verse">23</span> But they didn’t listen. They didn’t turn their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.   <span class="verse">24</span> It will happen, if you diligently listen to me,” says Yahweh, “to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to make the Sabbath day holy, to do no work therein;   <span class="verse">25</span> then there will enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on David’s throne, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will remain forever.   <span class="verse">26</span> They will come from the cities of Judah, and from the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country, and from the South, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, meal offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving, to Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">27</span> But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem. It will not be quenched.” ’ ”

		<span class="reference">Ecclesiastes 5:1-7</span>  <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Guard your steps when you go to God’s house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they don’t know that they do evil.   <span class="verse">2</span> Don’t be rash with your mouth, and don’t let your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few.   <span class="verse">3</span> For as a dream comes with a multitude of cares, so a fool’s speech with a multitude of words.   <span class="verse">4</span> When you vow a vow to God, don’t defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you vow.   <span class="verse">5</span> It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay.   <span class="verse">6</span> Don’t allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Don’t protest before the messenger that this was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice, and destroy the work of your hands?   <span class="verse">7</span> For in the multitude of dreams there are vanities, as well as in many words; but you must fear God.

Don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace!” <span class="verse">17</span> His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.” <span class="verse">18</span> The Jews therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?”  <span class="verse">19</span> Jesus answered them,  “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” <span class="verse">20</span> The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?”   <span class="verse">21</span> But he spoke of the temple of his body.   <span class="verse">22</span> When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.  <span class="verse">23</span> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.   <span class="verse">24</span> But Jesus didn’t entrust himself to them, because he knew everyone,   <span class="verse">25</span> and because he didn’t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.

Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.
