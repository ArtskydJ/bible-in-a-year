		<span class="reference">Ruth 3</span>  <span class="chapter">3</span><span class="verse">1</span> Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, “My daughter, shall I not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?   <span class="verse">2</span> Now isn’t Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were? Behold, he will be winnowing barley tonight on the threshing floor.   <span class="verse">3</span> Therefore wash yourself, anoint yourself, get dressed, and go down to the threshing floor; but don’t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.   <span class="verse">4</span> It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall note the place where he is lying. Then you shall go in, uncover his feet, and lay down. Then he will tell you what to do.”  <span class="verse">5</span> She said to her, “All that you say, I will do.”   <span class="verse">6</span> She went down to the threshing floor, and did everything that her mother-in-law told her.   <span class="verse">7</span> When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain. She came softly, uncovered his feet, and laid down.   <span class="verse">8</span> At midnight, the man was startled and turned himself; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.   <span class="verse">9</span> He said, “Who are you?”  She answered, “I am Ruth your servant. Therefore spread the corner of your garment over your servant; for you are a near kinsman.”  <span class="verse">10</span> He said, “You are blessed by Yahweh, my daughter. You have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, because you didn’t follow young men, whether poor or rich.   <span class="verse">11</span> Now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people knows that you are a worthy woman.   <span class="verse">12</span> Now it is true that I am a near kinsman. However, there is a kinsman nearer than I.   <span class="verse">13</span> Stay this night, and in the morning, if he will perform for you the part of a kinsman, good. Let him do the kinsman’s duty. But if he will not do the duty of a kinsman for you, then I will do the duty of a kinsman for you, as Yahweh lives. Lie down until the morning.”  <span class="verse">14</span> She lay at his feet until the morning, then she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, “Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor.”   <span class="verse">15</span> He said, “Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it.” She held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; then he went into the city.  <span class="verse">16</span> When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, “How did it go, my daughter?”  She told her all that the man had done for her.   <span class="verse">17</span> She said, “He gave me these six measures of barley; for he said, ‘Don’t go empty to your mother-in-law.’ ”  <span class="verse">18</span> Then she said, “Wait, my daughter, until you know what will happen; for the man will not rest until he has settled this today.”

The world also is established.  It can’t be moved.  <span class="verse">2</span> Your throne is established from long ago.  You are from everlasting.  <span class="verse">3</span> The floods have lifted up, Yahweh,  the floods have lifted up their voice.

Holiness adorns your house,  Yahweh, forever more.

Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”   <span class="verse">6</span> For he didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.  <span class="verse">7</span> A cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only.  <span class="verse">9</span> As they were coming down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.   <span class="verse">10</span> They kept this saying to themselves, questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.  <span class="verse">11</span> They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”  <span class="verse">12</span> He said to them,  “Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised?  <span class="verse">13</span> But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is written about him.”

The second man is the Lord from heaven.   <span class="verse">48</span> As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.   <span class="verse">49</span> As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let’s  also bear the image of the heavenly.   <span class="verse">50</span> Now I say this, brothers,  that flesh and blood can’t inherit God’s Kingdom; neither does the perishable inherit imperishable.  <span class="verse">51</span> Behold,  I tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,   <span class="verse">52</span> in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.   <span class="verse">53</span> For this perishable body must become imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.   <span class="verse">54</span> But when this perishable body will have become imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written will happen: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” <span class="verse">55</span> “Death, where is your sting?  Hades,  where is your victory?” <span class="verse">56</span> The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.   <span class="verse">57</span> But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.   <span class="verse">58</span> Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord’s work, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
