This shall be your south border.   <span class="verse">5</span> The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan. The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan.   <span class="verse">6</span> The border went up to Beth Hoglah, and passed along by the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.   <span class="verse">7</span> The border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that faces the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river. The border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh, and ended at En Rogel.   <span class="verse">8</span> The border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the side of the Jebusite (also called Jerusalem) southward; and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the farthest part of the valley of Rephaim northward.   <span class="verse">9</span> The border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah (also called Kiriath Jearim);   <span class="verse">10</span> and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir, and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim (also called Chesalon) on the north, and went down to Beth Shemesh, and passed along by Timnah;   <span class="verse">11</span> and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward; and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.   <span class="verse">12</span> The west border was to the shore of the great sea. This is the border of the children of Judah according to their families.  <span class="verse">13</span> He gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh a portion among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua, even Kiriath Arba, named after the father of Anak (also called Hebron).   <span class="verse">14</span> Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.   <span class="verse">15</span> He went up against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.   <span class="verse">16</span> Caleb said, “He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it, to him I will give Achsah my daughter as wife.”   <span class="verse">17</span> Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.   <span class="verse">18</span> When she came, she had him ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey, and Caleb said, “What do you want?”  <span class="verse">19</span> She said, “Give me a blessing. Because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.”  So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.  <span class="verse">20</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.   <span class="verse">21</span> The farthest cities of the tribe of the children of Judah toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,   <span class="verse">22</span> Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,   <span class="verse">23</span> Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,   <span class="verse">24</span> Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,   <span class="verse">25</span> Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (also called Hazor),   <span class="verse">26</span> Amam, Shema, Moladah,   <span class="verse">27</span> Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet,   <span class="verse">28</span> Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,   <span class="verse">29</span> Baalah, Iim, Ezem,   <span class="verse">30</span> Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah,   <span class="verse">31</span> Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,   <span class="verse">32</span> Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon.

Indeed, I cry to God for help,  and for him to listen to me.  <span class="verse">2</span> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.  My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired.  My soul refused to be comforted.  <span class="verse">3</span> I remember God, and I groan.  I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.  <span class="verse">4</span> You hold my eyelids open.  I am so troubled that I can’t speak.  <span class="verse">5</span> I have considered the days of old,  the years of ancient times.  <span class="verse">6</span> I remember my song in the night.  I consider in my own heart;  my spirit diligently inquires:  <span class="verse">7</span> “Will the Lord reject us forever?  Will he be favorable no more?  <span class="verse">8</span> Has his loving kindness vanished forever?  Does his promise fail for generations?  <span class="verse">9</span> Has God forgotten to be gracious?  Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?”  <span class="verse">10</span> Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:  the years of the right hand of the Most High.”  <span class="verse">11</span> I will remember Yah’s deeds;  for I will remember your wonders of old.  <span class="verse">12</span> I will also meditate on all your work,  and consider your doings.  <span class="verse">13</span> Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.  What god is great like God?  <span class="verse">14</span> You are the God who does wonders.  You have made your strength known among the peoples.  <span class="verse">15</span> You have redeemed your people with your arm,  the sons of Jacob and Joseph.  <span class="verse">16</span> The waters saw you, God.  The waters saw you, and they writhed.  The depths also convulsed.  <span class="verse">17</span> The clouds poured out water.  The skies resounded with thunder.  Your arrows also flashed around.  <span class="verse">18</span> The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.  The lightnings lit up the world.  The earth trembled and shook.  <span class="verse">19</span> Your way was through the sea;  your paths through the great waters.  Your footsteps were not known.  <span class="verse">20</span> You led your people like a flock,  by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.  <span class="verse">20</span> But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.  <span class="verse">21</span> No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.  <span class="verse">22</span> No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins.” <span class="verse">23</span> He was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.   <span class="verse">24</span> The Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”  <span class="verse">25</span> He said to them,  “Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry—he, and those who were with him?  <span class="verse">26</span> How he entered into God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?” <span class="verse">27</span> He said to them,  “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.  <span class="verse">28</span> Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”

And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?   <span class="verse">3</span> Don’t you know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?   <span class="verse">4</span> If then you have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the assembly?   <span class="verse">5</span> I say this to move you to shame. Isn’t there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers?   <span class="verse">6</span> But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers!   <span class="verse">7</span> Therefore it is already altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?   <span class="verse">8</span> No, but you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and that against your brothers.   <span class="verse">9</span> Or don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit God’s Kingdom? Don’t be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexuals,   <span class="verse">10</span> nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortionists, will inherit God’s Kingdom.   <span class="verse">11</span> Some of you were such, but you were washed. But you were sanctified. But you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.
