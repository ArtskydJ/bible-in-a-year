		<span class="reference">Judges 17-18</span>  <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.   <span class="verse">2</span> He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears—behold, the silver is with me. I took it.”  His mother said, “May Yahweh bless my son!”  <span class="verse">3</span> He restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, then his mother said, “I most certainly dedicate the silver to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.”  <span class="verse">4</span> When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten image out of it. It was in the house of Micah.  <span class="verse">5</span> The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim,  and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.   <span class="verse">6</span> In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.   <span class="verse">7</span> There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he lived there.   <span class="verse">8</span> The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah, to live where he could find a place, and he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, as he traveled.   <span class="verse">9</span> Micah said to him, “Where did you come from?”  He said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I am looking for a place to live.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Micah said to him, “Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year, a suit of clothing, and your food.” So the Levite went in.   <span class="verse">11</span> The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.   <span class="verse">12</span> Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.   <span class="verse">13</span> Then Micah said, “Now I know that Yahweh will do good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest.”   <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> In those days there was no king in Israel. In those days the tribe of the Danites sought an inheritance to dwell in; for to that day, their inheritance had not fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.   <span class="verse">2</span> The children of Dan sent five men of their family from their whole number, men of valor, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it. They said to them, “Go, explore the land!”  They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there.   <span class="verse">3</span> When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; so they went over there and said to him, “Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What do you have here?”  <span class="verse">4</span> He said to them, “Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”  <span class="verse">5</span> They said to him, “Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.”  <span class="verse">6</span> The priest said to them, “Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before Yahweh.”  <span class="verse">7</span> Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in safety, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and secure; for there was no one in the land possessing authority, that might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone else.   <span class="verse">8</span> They came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brothers asked them, “What do you say?”  <span class="verse">9</span> They said, “Arise, and let’s go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. Do you stand still? Don’t be slothful to go and to enter in to possess the land.   <span class="verse">10</span> When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people, and the land is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth.”  <span class="verse">11</span> The family of the Danites set out from Zorah and Eshtaol with six hundred men armed with weapons of war.   <span class="verse">12</span> They went up and encamped in Kiriath Jearim in Judah. Therefore they call that place Mahaneh Dan to this day. Behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.   <span class="verse">13</span> They passed from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah.  <span class="verse">14</span> Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered and said to their brothers, “Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim,  and a carved image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you have to do.”   <span class="verse">15</span> They went over there and came to the house of the young Levite man, even to the house of Micah, and asked him how he was doing.   <span class="verse">16</span> The six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.   <span class="verse">17</span> The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came in there, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image; and the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.  <span class="verse">18</span> When these went into Micah’s house, and took the engraved image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”  <span class="verse">19</span> They said to him, “Hold your peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us. Be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?”  <span class="verse">20</span> The priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the people.   <span class="verse">21</span> So they turned and departed, and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them.   <span class="verse">22</span> When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the children of Dan.   <span class="verse">23</span> As they called to the children of Dan, they turned their faces, and said to Micah, “What ails you, that you come with such a company?”  <span class="verse">24</span> He said, “You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone away! What more do I have? How can you ask me, ‘What ails you?’ ”  <span class="verse">25</span> The children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.”  <span class="verse">26</span> The children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.   <span class="verse">27</span> They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they burned the city with fire.   <span class="verse">28</span> There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They built the city and lived in it.   <span class="verse">29</span> They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; however the name of the city used to be Laish.   <span class="verse">30</span> The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.   <span class="verse">31</span> So they set up for themselves Micah’s engraved image which he made, and it remained all the time that God’s house was in Shiloh.

He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.   <span class="verse">25</span> For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.   <span class="verse">26</span> Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.   <span class="verse">27</span> But Jesus said to her,  “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”  <span class="verse">28</span> But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”  <span class="verse">29</span> He said to her,  “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.” <span class="verse">30</span> She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.  <span class="verse">31</span> Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the region of Decapolis.   <span class="verse">32</span> They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.   <span class="verse">33</span> He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.   <span class="verse">34</span> Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him,  “Ephphatha!”   that is,  “Be opened!” <span class="verse">35</span> Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.   <span class="verse">36</span> He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.   <span class="verse">37</span> They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!”

For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.  <span class="verse">6</span> But now, brothers,  if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?   <span class="verse">7</span> Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they didn’t give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or harped?   <span class="verse">8</span> For if the trumpet gave an uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war?   <span class="verse">9</span> So also you, unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken? For you would be speaking into the air.   <span class="verse">10</span> There are, it may be, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them is without meaning.   <span class="verse">11</span> If then I don’t know the meaning of the sound, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks would be a foreigner to me.   <span class="verse">12</span> So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly.
