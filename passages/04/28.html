		<span class="reference">Ruth 2</span>  <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.   <span class="verse">2</span> Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.”  She said to her, “Go, my daughter.”   <span class="verse">3</span> She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.  <span class="verse">4</span> Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.”  They answered him, “May Yahweh bless you.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?”  <span class="verse">6</span> The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.   <span class="verse">7</span> She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.   <span class="verse">9</span> Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?”  <span class="verse">11</span> Boaz answered her, “I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before.   <span class="verse">12</span> May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.”  <span class="verse">13</span> Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.”  <span class="verse">14</span> At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.”  She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it.   <span class="verse">15</span> When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her.   <span class="verse">16</span> Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.”  <span class="verse">17</span> So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah  of barley.   <span class="verse">18</span> She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough.  <span class="verse">19</span> Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.”  She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.”   <span class="verse">20</span> Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not abandoned his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.”  <span class="verse">21</span> Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ”  <span class="verse">22</span> Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.”   <span class="verse">23</span> So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.

I will triumph in the works of your hands.  <span class="verse">5</span> How great are your works, Yahweh!  Your thoughts are very deep.  <span class="verse">6</span> A senseless man doesn’t know,  neither does a fool understand this:  <span class="verse">7</span> though the wicked spring up as the grass,  and all the evildoers flourish,  they will be destroyed forever.  <span class="verse">8</span> But you, Yahweh, are on high forever more.  <span class="verse">9</span> For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh,  for, behold, your enemies shall perish.  All the evildoers will be scattered.  <span class="verse">10</span> But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox.  I am anointed with fresh oil.  <span class="verse">11</span> My eye has also seen my enemies.  My ears have heard of the wicked enemies who rise up against me.  <span class="verse">12</span> The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.  He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.  <span class="verse">13</span> They are planted in Yahweh’s house.  They will flourish in our God’s courts.  <span class="verse">14</span> They will still produce fruit in old age.  They will be full of sap and green,  <span class="verse">15</span> to show that Yahweh is upright.  He is my rock,  and there is no unrighteousness in him.

Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.   <span class="verse">33</span> But he, turning around, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and said,  “Get behind me, Satan! For you have in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.” <span class="verse">34</span> He called the multitude to himself with his disciples, and said to them,  “Whoever wants to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.  <span class="verse">35</span> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.  <span class="verse">36</span> For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?  <span class="verse">37</span> For what will a man give in exchange for his life?  <span class="verse">38</span> For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in his Father’s glory, with the holy angels.”

		<span class="reference">1 Corinthians 15:29-45</span>  <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">29</span> Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead aren’t raised at all, why then are they baptized for the dead?   <span class="verse">30</span> Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?   <span class="verse">31</span> I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.   <span class="verse">32</span> If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, then “let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.” <span class="verse">33</span> Don’t be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.”   <span class="verse">34</span> Wake up righteously, and don’t sin, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.  <span class="verse">35</span> But someone will say, “How are the dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they come?”   <span class="verse">36</span> You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive unless it dies.   <span class="verse">37</span> That which you sow, you don’t sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.   <span class="verse">38</span> But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.   <span class="verse">39</span> All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.   <span class="verse">40</span> There are also celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.   <span class="verse">41</span> There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.   <span class="verse">42</span> So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown perishable; it is raised imperishable.   <span class="verse">43</span> It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.   <span class="verse">44</span> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.  <span class="verse">45</span> So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul.”   The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
