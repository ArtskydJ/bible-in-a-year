It was this way with all these cities.  <span class="verse">43</span> So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give to their fathers. They possessed it, and lived in it.   <span class="verse">44</span> Yahweh gave them rest all around, according to all that he swore to their fathers. Not a man of all their enemies stood before them. Yahweh delivered all their enemies into their hand.   <span class="verse">45</span> Nothing failed of any good thing which Yahweh had spoken to the house of Israel. All came to pass.

He didn’t spare their soul from death,  but gave their life over to the pestilence,  <span class="verse">51</span> and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,  the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.  <span class="verse">52</span> But he led out his own people like sheep,  and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.  <span class="verse">53</span> He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,  but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.  <span class="verse">54</span> He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,  to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.  <span class="verse">55</span> He also drove out the nations before them,  allotted them for an inheritance by line,  and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

So I command in all the assemblies.  <span class="verse">18</span> Was anyone called having been circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.   <span class="verse">19</span> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.   <span class="verse">20</span> Let each man stay in that calling in which he was called.   <span class="verse">21</span> Were you called being a bondservant? Don’t let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity to become free, use it.   <span class="verse">22</span> For he who was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord’s free man. Likewise he who was called being free is Christ’s bondservant.   <span class="verse">23</span> You were bought with a price. Don’t become bondservants of men.   <span class="verse">24</span> Brothers, let each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition with God.  <span class="verse">25</span> Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy.   <span class="verse">26</span> Therefore I think that because of the distress that is on us, that it’s good for a man to remain as he is.   <span class="verse">27</span> Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek to be freed. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife.   <span class="verse">28</span> But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.   <span class="verse">29</span> But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;   <span class="verse">30</span> and those who weep, as though they didn’t weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn’t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn’t possess;   <span class="verse">31</span> and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes away.
