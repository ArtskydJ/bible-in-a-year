		<span class="reference">Joshua 1-2</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,  Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ servant, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go across this Jordan, you and all these people, to the land which I am giving to them, even to the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">3</span> I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will tread on, as I told Moses.   <span class="verse">4</span> From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.   <span class="verse">5</span> No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not fail you nor forsake you.  <span class="verse">6</span> “Be strong and courageous; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.   <span class="verse">7</span> Only be strong and very courageous. Be careful to observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded you. Don’t turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.   <span class="verse">8</span> This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.   <span class="verse">9</span> Haven’t I commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid. Don’t be dismayed, for Yahweh your God  is with you wherever you go.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,   <span class="verse">11</span> “Pass through the middle of the camp, and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you to possess.’ ”  <span class="verse">12</span> Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,   <span class="verse">13</span> “Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God gives you rest, and will give you this land.   <span class="verse">14</span> Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them   <span class="verse">15</span> until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as he has given you, and they have also possessed the land which Yahweh your God gives them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.’ ”  <span class="verse">16</span> They answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.   <span class="verse">17</span> Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.   <span class="verse">18</span> Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn’t listen to your words in all that you command him shall himself be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”   <span class="chapter">2</span><span class="verse">1</span> Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim as spies, saying, “Go, view the land, including Jericho.” They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and slept there.  <span class="verse">2</span> The king of Jericho was told, “Behold,  men of the children of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Jericho’s king sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who have entered into your house; for they have come to spy out all the land.”  <span class="verse">4</span> The woman took the two men and hid them. Then she said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I didn’t know where they came from.   <span class="verse">5</span> About the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, the men went out. Where the men went, I don’t know. Pursue them quickly. You may catch up with them.”   <span class="verse">6</span> But she had brought them up to the roof, and hidden them under the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.   <span class="verse">7</span> The men pursued them along the way to the fords of the Jordan River. As soon as those who pursued them had gone out, they shut the gate.   <span class="verse">8</span> Before they had lain down, she came up to them on the roof.   <span class="verse">9</span> She said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.   <span class="verse">10</span> For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.   <span class="verse">11</span> As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, and there wasn’t any more spirit in any man, because of you: for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.   <span class="verse">12</span> Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my father’s house, and give me a true sign;   <span class="verse">13</span> and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.”  <span class="verse">14</span> The men said to her, “Our life for yours, if you don’t talk about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.”  <span class="verse">15</span> Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived on the wall.   <span class="verse">16</span> She said to them, “Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you. Hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned. Afterward, you may go your way.”  <span class="verse">17</span> The men said to her, “We will be guiltless of this your oath which you’ve made us to swear.   <span class="verse">18</span> Behold, when we come into the land, tie this line of scarlet thread in the window which you used to let us down. Gather to yourself into the house your father, your mother, your brothers, and all your father’s household.   <span class="verse">19</span> It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless. Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand is on him.   <span class="verse">20</span> But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless of your oath which you’ve made us to swear.”  <span class="verse">21</span> She said, “Let it be as you have said.” She sent them away, and they departed. Then she tied the scarlet line in the window.  <span class="verse">22</span> They went and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. The pursuers sought them all along the way, but didn’t find them.   <span class="verse">23</span> Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain, crossed the river, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. They told him all that had happened to them.   <span class="verse">24</span> They said to Joshua, “Truly Yahweh has delivered all the land into our hands. Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.”

The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.  <span class="verse">4</span> He will judge the poor of the people.  He will save the children of the needy,  and will break the oppressor in pieces.  <span class="verse">5</span> They shall fear you while the sun endures;  and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.  <span class="verse">6</span> He will come down like rain on the mown grass,  as showers that water the earth.  <span class="verse">7</span> In his days, the righteous shall flourish,  and abundance of peace, until the moon is no more.  <span class="verse">8</span> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,  from the River to the ends of the earth.  <span class="verse">9</span> Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.  His enemies shall lick the dust.  <span class="verse">10</span> The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.  The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.  <span class="verse">11</span> Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.  All nations shall serve him.  <span class="verse">12</span> For he will deliver the needy when he cries;  the poor, who has no helper.  <span class="verse">13</span> He will have pity on the poor and needy.  He will save the souls of the needy.  <span class="verse">14</span> He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.  Their blood will be precious in his sight.  <span class="verse">15</span> They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.  Men shall pray for him continually.  They shall bless him all day long.  <span class="verse">16</span> Abundance of grain shall be throughout the land.  Its fruit sways like Lebanon.  Let it flourish, thriving like the grass of the field.  <span class="verse">17</span> His name endures forever.  His name continues as long as the sun.  Men shall be blessed by him.  All nations will call him blessed.  <span class="verse">18</span> Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel,  who alone does marvelous deeds.  <span class="verse">19</span> Blessed be his glorious name forever!  Let the whole earth be filled with his glory!  Amen and amen.  <span class="verse">20</span> This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.

Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?   <span class="verse">14</span> I thank God that I baptized none of you, except Crispus and Gaius,   <span class="verse">15</span> so that no one should say that I had baptized you into my own name.   <span class="verse">16</span> (I also baptized the household of Stephanas; besides them, I don’t know whether I baptized any other.)   <span class="verse">17</span> For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Good News—not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of Christ wouldn’t be made void.
