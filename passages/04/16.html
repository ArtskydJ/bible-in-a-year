		<span class="reference">Judges 4-5</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> The children of Israel again did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, when Ehud was dead.   <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.   <span class="verse">3</span> The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed the children of Israel for twenty years.   <span class="verse">4</span> Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time.   <span class="verse">5</span> She lived under Deborah’s palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.   <span class="verse">6</span> She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, “Hasn’t Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, ‘Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?   <span class="verse">7</span> I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’ ”  <span class="verse">8</span> Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”  <span class="verse">9</span> She said, “I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into a woman’s hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.  <span class="verse">10</span> Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him.   <span class="verse">11</span> Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.   <span class="verse">12</span> They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.   <span class="verse">13</span> Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.  <span class="verse">14</span> Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t Yahweh gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.   <span class="verse">15</span> Yahweh confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled away on his feet.   <span class="verse">16</span> But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.  <span class="verse">17</span> However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.   <span class="verse">18</span> Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.  <span class="verse">19</span> He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.”  She opened a container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him.  <span class="verse">20</span> He said to her, “Stand in the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’ ”  <span class="verse">21</span> Then Jael Heber’s wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and died.   <span class="verse">22</span> Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.   <span class="verse">23</span> So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel on that day.   <span class="verse">24</span> The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.   <span class="chapter">5</span><span class="verse">1</span> Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,  <span class="verse">2</span> “Because the leaders took the lead in Israel,  because the people offered themselves willingly,  be blessed, Yahweh!  <span class="verse">3</span> “Hear, you kings!  Give ear, you princes!  I, even I, will sing to Yahweh.  I will sing praise to Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <span class="verse">4</span> “Yahweh, when you went out of Seir,  when you marched out of the field of Edom,  the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.  Yes, the clouds dropped water.  <span class="verse">5</span> The mountains quaked Yahweh’s presence,  even Sinai at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.  <span class="verse">6</span> “In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,  in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied.  The travelers walked through byways.  <span class="verse">7</span> The rulers ceased in Israel.  They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;  Until I arose a mother in Israel.  <span class="verse">8</span> They chose new gods.  Then war was in the gates.  Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?  <span class="verse">9</span> My heart is toward the governors of Israel,  who offered themselves willingly among the people.  Bless Yahweh!  <span class="verse">10</span> “Speak, you who ride on white donkeys,  you who sit on rich carpets,  and you who walk by the way.  <span class="verse">11</span> Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water,  there they will rehearse Yahweh’s righteous acts,  the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.  “Then Yahweh’s people went down to the gates.  <span class="verse">12</span> ‘Awake, awake, Deborah!  Awake, awake, utter a song!  Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.’  <span class="verse">13</span> “Then a remnant of the nobles and the people came down.  Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.  <span class="verse">14</span> Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim,  after you, Benjamin, among your peoples.  Governors come down out of Machir.  Those who handle the marshal’s staff came out of Zebulun.  <span class="verse">15</span> The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.  As was Issachar, so was Barak.  They rushed into the valley at his feet.  By the watercourses of Reuben,  there were great resolves of heart.  <span class="verse">16</span> Why did you sit among the sheepfolds?  To hear the whistling for the flocks?  At the watercourses of Reuben,  there were great searchings of heart.  <span class="verse">17</span> Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.  Why did Dan remain in ships?  Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,  and lived by his creeks.  <span class="verse">18</span> Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the death;  Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.  <span class="verse">19</span> “The kings came and fought,  then the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.  They took no plunder of silver.  <span class="verse">20</span> From the sky the stars fought.  From their courses, they fought against Sisera.  <span class="verse">21</span> The river Kishon swept them away,  that ancient river, the river Kishon.  My soul, march on with strength.  <span class="verse">22</span> Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancing,  the prancing of their strong ones.  <span class="verse">23</span> ‘Curse Meroz,’ said Yahweh’s angel.  ‘Curse bitterly its inhabitants,  because they didn’t come to help Yahweh,  to help Yahweh against the mighty.’  <span class="verse">24</span> “Jael shall be blessed above women,  the wife of Heber the Kenite;  blessed shall she be above women in the tent.  <span class="verse">25</span> He asked for water.  She gave him milk.  She brought him butter in a lordly dish.  <span class="verse">26</span> She put her hand to the tent peg,  and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer.  With the hammer she struck Sisera.  She struck through his head.  Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.  <span class="verse">27</span> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.  At her feet he bowed, he fell.  Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.  <span class="verse">28</span> “Through the window she looked out, and cried:  Sisera’s mother looked through the lattice.  ‘Why is his chariot so long in coming?  Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?’  <span class="verse">29</span> Her wise ladies answered her,  Yes, she returned answer to herself,  <span class="verse">30</span> ‘Have they not found, have they not divided the plunder?  A lady, two ladies to every man;  to Sisera a plunder of dyed garments,  a plunder of dyed garments embroidered,  of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the plunder?’  <span class="verse">31</span> “So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh,  but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises in its strength.”  Then the land had rest forty years.

He judges among the gods.  <span class="verse">2</span> “How long will you judge unjustly,  and show partiality to the wicked?”  <span class="verse">3</span> “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.  Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.  <span class="verse">4</span> Rescue the weak and needy.  Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.”  <span class="verse">5</span> They don’t know, neither do they understand.  They walk back and forth in darkness.  All the foundations of the earth are shaken.  <span class="verse">6</span> I said, “You are gods,  all of you are sons of the Most High.  <span class="verse">7</span> Nevertheless you shall die like men,  and fall like one of the rulers.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Arise, God, judge the earth,  for you inherit all of the nations.

Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”  <span class="verse">24</span> He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.   <span class="verse">25</span> A certain woman, who had a discharge of blood for twelve years,   <span class="verse">26</span> and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,   <span class="verse">27</span> having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.   <span class="verse">28</span> For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well.”   <span class="verse">29</span> Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.  <span class="verse">30</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked,  “Who touched my clothes?” <span class="verse">31</span> His disciples said to him, “You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’ ”  <span class="verse">32</span> He looked around to see her who had done this thing.   <span class="verse">33</span> But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.  <span class="verse">34</span> He said to her,  “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.” <span class="verse">35</span> While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”  <span class="verse">36</span> But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue,  “Don’t be afraid, only believe.” <span class="verse">37</span> He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.   <span class="verse">38</span> He came to the synagogue ruler’s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.   <span class="verse">39</span> When he had entered in, he said to them,  “Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep.” <span class="verse">40</span> They ridiculed him. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.   <span class="verse">41</span> Taking the child by the hand, he said to her,  “Talitha cumi!”   which means, being interpreted,  “Girl, I tell you, get up!”  <span class="verse">42</span> Immediately the girl rose up and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.   <span class="verse">43</span> He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat.

For they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.   <span class="verse">5</span> However with most of them, God was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.   <span class="verse">6</span> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.   <span class="verse">7</span> Don’t be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.” <span class="verse">8</span> Let’s not commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell.   <span class="verse">9</span> Let’s not test Christ,  as some of them tested, and perished by the serpents.   <span class="verse">10</span> Don’t grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.   <span class="verse">11</span> Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.   <span class="verse">12</span> Therefore let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn’t fall.  <span class="verse">13</span> No temptation has taken you except what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
