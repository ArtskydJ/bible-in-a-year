		<span class="reference">Joshua 17-18</span>  <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> This was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.   <span class="verse">2</span> So this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida. These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.   <span class="verse">3</span> But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.   <span class="verse">4</span> They came to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the princes, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” Therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father.   <span class="verse">5</span> Ten parts fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;   <span class="verse">6</span> because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.   <span class="verse">7</span> The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.   <span class="verse">8</span> The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.   <span class="verse">9</span> The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and ended at the sea.   <span class="verse">10</span> Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border. They reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east.   <span class="verse">11</span> Manasseh had three heights in Issachar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns.   <span class="verse">12</span> Yet the children of Manasseh couldn’t drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.  <span class="verse">13</span> When the children of Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn’t utterly drive them out.   <span class="verse">14</span> The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance, since we are a numerous people, because Yahweh has blessed us so far?”  <span class="verse">15</span> Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.”  <span class="verse">16</span> The children of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.”  <span class="verse">17</span> Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only;   <span class="verse">18</span> but the hill country shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it’s farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.”   <span class="chapter">18</span><span class="verse">1</span> The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves together at Shiloh, and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The land was subdued before them.   <span class="verse">2</span> Seven tribes remained among the children of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance.   <span class="verse">3</span> Joshua said to the children of Israel, “How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you?   <span class="verse">4</span> Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; then they shall come to me.   <span class="verse">5</span> They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north.   <span class="verse">6</span> You shall survey the land into seven parts, and bring the description here to me; and I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh our God.   <span class="verse">7</span> However, the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance east of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.”  <span class="verse">8</span> The men arose and went. Joshua commanded those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go walk through the land, survey it, and come again to me. I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.”  <span class="verse">9</span> The men went and passed through the land, and surveyed it by cities into seven portions in a book. They came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.   <span class="verse">10</span> Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh. There Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel according to their divisions.  <span class="verse">11</span> The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families. The border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.   <span class="verse">12</span> Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan. The border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill country westward. It ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.   <span class="verse">13</span> The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (also called Bethel), southward. The border went down to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth Horon the lower.   <span class="verse">14</span> The border extended, and turned around on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth Horon southward; and ended at Kiriath Baal (also called Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah. This was the west quarter.   <span class="verse">15</span> The south quarter was from the farthest part of Kiriath Jearim. The border went out westward, and went out to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.   <span class="verse">16</span> The border went down to the farthest part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward. It went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En Rogel.   <span class="verse">17</span> It extended northward, went out at En Shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim. It went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben.   <span class="verse">18</span> It passed along to the side opposite the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah.   <span class="verse">19</span> The border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward; and the border ended at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the south border.   <span class="verse">20</span> The Jordan was its border on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the borders around it, according to their families.   <span class="verse">21</span> Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,   <span class="verse">22</span> Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,   <span class="verse">23</span> Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,   <span class="verse">24</span> Chephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages.   <span class="verse">25</span> Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,   <span class="verse">26</span> Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,   <span class="verse">27</span> Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,   <span class="verse">28</span> Zelah, Eleph, the Jebusite (also called Jerusalem), Gibeath, and Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families.

Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.  <span class="verse">2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable.  I will utter dark sayings of old,  <span class="verse">3</span> Which we have heard and known,  and our fathers have told us.  <span class="verse">4</span> We will not hide them from their children,  telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,  his strength, and his wondrous deeds that he has done.  <span class="verse">5</span> For he established a covenant in Jacob,  and appointed a teaching in Israel,  which he commanded our fathers,  that they should make them known to their children;  <span class="verse">6</span> that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;  who should arise and tell their children,  <span class="verse">7</span> that they might set their hope in God,  and not forget God’s deeds,  but keep his commandments,  <span class="verse">8</span> and might not be as their fathers,  a stubborn and rebellious generation,  a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,  whose spirit was not steadfast with God.  <span class="verse">9</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,  turned back in the day of battle.  <span class="verse">10</span> They didn’t keep God’s covenant,  and refused to walk in his law.  <span class="verse">11</span> They forgot his doings,  his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.  <span class="verse">12</span> He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,  in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.  <span class="verse">13</span> He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.  He made the waters stand as a heap.  <span class="verse">14</span> In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,  and all night with a light of fire.  <span class="verse">15</span> He split rocks in the wilderness,  and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.  <span class="verse">16</span> He brought streams also out of the rock,  and caused waters to run down like rivers.  <span class="verse">17</span> Yet they still went on to sin against him,  to rebel against the Most High in the desert.  <span class="verse">18</span> They tempted God in their heart  by asking food according to their desire.

To save a life, or to kill?”  But they were silent.   <span class="verse">5</span> When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man,  “Stretch out your hand.”   He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.   <span class="verse">6</span> The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.  <span class="verse">7</span> Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,   <span class="verse">8</span> from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.   <span class="verse">9</span> He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him.   <span class="verse">10</span> For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.   <span class="verse">11</span> The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of God!”   <span class="verse">12</span> He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.

But the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.   <span class="verse">14</span> Now God raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up by his power.   <span class="verse">15</span> Don’t you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never be!   <span class="verse">16</span> Or don’t you know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For, “The two”, he says, “will become one flesh.” <span class="verse">17</span> But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.   <span class="verse">18</span> Flee sexual immorality! “Every sin that a man does is outside the body,” but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.   <span class="verse">19</span> Or don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own,   <span class="verse">20</span> for you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.
