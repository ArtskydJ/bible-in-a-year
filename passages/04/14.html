		<span class="reference">Judges 1</span>  <span class="chapter">1</span><span class="verse">1</span> After the death of Joshua, the children of Israel asked of Yahweh,   saying, “Who should go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?”  <span class="verse">2</span> Yahweh said, “Judah shall go up. Behold,  I have delivered the land into his hand.”  <span class="verse">3</span> Judah said to Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.” So Simeon went with him.   <span class="verse">4</span> Judah went up, and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand. They struck ten thousand men in Bezek.   <span class="verse">5</span> They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him. They struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.   <span class="verse">6</span> But Adoni-Bezek fled. They pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes.   <span class="verse">7</span> Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their big toes cut off, scavenged under my table. As I have done, so God  has done to me.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.   <span class="verse">8</span> The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.  <span class="verse">9</span> After that, the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South, and in the lowland.   <span class="verse">10</span> Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (The name of Hebron before that was Kiriath Arba.) They struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.  <span class="verse">11</span> From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir before that was Kiriath Sepher.)   <span class="verse">12</span> Caleb said, “I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it.”   <span class="verse">13</span> Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it, so he gave him Achsah his daughter as his wife.  <span class="verse">14</span> When she came, she got him to ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey; and Caleb said to her, “What would you like?”  <span class="verse">15</span> She said to him, “Give me a blessing; because you have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.   <span class="verse">16</span> The children of the Kenite, Moses’ brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad; and they went and lived with the people.   <span class="verse">17</span> Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah.   <span class="verse">18</span> Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border.   <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh was with Judah, and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.   <span class="verse">20</span> They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of there.   <span class="verse">21</span> The children of Benjamin didn’t drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.  <span class="verse">22</span> The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and Yahweh was with them.   <span class="verse">23</span> The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city before that was Luz.)   <span class="verse">24</span> The watchers saw a man come out of the city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.”   <span class="verse">25</span> He showed them the entrance into the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go.   <span class="verse">26</span> The man went into the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day.  <span class="verse">27</span> Manasseh didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.   <span class="verse">28</span> When Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn’t utterly drive them out.   <span class="verse">29</span> Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.   <span class="verse">30</span> Zebulun didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them, and became subject to forced labor.   <span class="verse">31</span> Asher didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;   <span class="verse">32</span> but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they didn’t drive them out.   <span class="verse">33</span> Naphtali didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labor.   <span class="verse">34</span> The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;   <span class="verse">35</span> but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labor.   <span class="verse">36</span> The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

		<span class="reference">Psalms 80</span>  <span class="chapter">80</span><span class="verse">1</span> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,  you who lead Joseph like a flock,  you who sit above the cherubim, shine out.  <span class="verse">2</span> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might!  Come to save us!  <span class="verse">3</span> Turn us again, God.  Cause your face to shine,  and we will be saved.  <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh God of Armies,  how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?  <span class="verse">5</span> You have fed them with the bread of tears,  and given them tears to drink in large measure.  <span class="verse">6</span> You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.  Our enemies laugh among themselves.  <span class="verse">7</span> Turn us again, God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine,  and we will be saved.  <span class="verse">8</span> You brought a vine out of Egypt.  You drove out the nations, and planted it.  <span class="verse">9</span> You cleared the ground for it.  It took deep root, and filled the land.  <span class="verse">10</span> The mountains were covered with its shadow.  Its boughs were like God’s cedars.  <span class="verse">11</span> It sent out its branches to the sea,  its shoots to the River.  <span class="verse">12</span> Why have you broken down its walls,  so that all those who pass by the way pluck it?  <span class="verse">13</span> The boar out of the wood ravages it.  The wild animals of the field feed on it.  <span class="verse">14</span> Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.  Look down from heaven, and see, and visit this vine,  <span class="verse">15</span> the stock which your right hand planted,  the branch that you made strong for yourself.  <span class="verse">16</span> It’s burned with fire.  It’s cut down.  They perish at your rebuke.  <span class="verse">17</span> Let your hand be on the man of your right hand,  on the son of man whom you made strong for yourself.  <span class="verse">18</span> So we will not turn away from you.  Revive us, and we will call on your name.  <span class="verse">19</span> Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine, and we will be saved.

Or with what parable will we illustrate it?  <span class="verse">31</span> It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,  <span class="verse">32</span> yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow.” <span class="verse">33</span> With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.   <span class="verse">34</span> Without a parable he didn’t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.  <span class="verse">35</span> On that day, when evening had come, he said to them,  “Let’s go over to the other side.” <span class="verse">36</span> Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.   <span class="verse">37</span> A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.   <span class="verse">38</span> He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are dying?”  <span class="verse">39</span> He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,  “Peace! Be still!”  The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.   <span class="verse">40</span> He said to them,  “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?” <span class="verse">41</span> They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”

Aren’t you my work in the Lord?   <span class="verse">2</span> If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.   <span class="verse">3</span> My defense to those who examine me is this:   <span class="verse">4</span> Have we no right to eat and to drink?   <span class="verse">5</span> Have we no right to take along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?   <span class="verse">6</span> Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work?   <span class="verse">7</span> What soldier ever serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard, and doesn’t eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a flock, and doesn’t drink from the flock’s milk?   <span class="verse">8</span> Do I speak these things according to the ways of men? Or doesn’t the law also say the same thing?   <span class="verse">9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.”  Is it for the oxen that God cares,   <span class="verse">10</span> or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes in hope should partake of his hope.   <span class="verse">11</span> If we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your fleshly things?   <span class="verse">12</span> If others partake of this right over you, don’t we yet more? Nevertheless we didn’t use this right, but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ.
