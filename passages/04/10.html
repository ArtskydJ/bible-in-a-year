		<span class="reference">Joshua 19-20</span>  <span class="chapter">19</span><span class="verse">1</span> The second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families. Their inheritance was in the middle of the inheritance of the children of Judah.   <span class="verse">2</span> They had for their inheritance Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah,   <span class="verse">3</span> Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,   <span class="verse">4</span> Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,   <span class="verse">5</span> Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,   <span class="verse">6</span> Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages;   <span class="verse">7</span> Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan; four cities with their villages;   <span class="verse">8</span> and all the villages that were around these cities to Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.   <span class="verse">9</span> Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children of Judah was too much for them. Therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the middle of their inheritance.  <span class="verse">10</span> The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according to their families. The border of their inheritance was to Sarid.   <span class="verse">11</span> Their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth. It reached to the brook that is before Jokneam.   <span class="verse">12</span> It turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to the border of Chisloth Tabor. It went out to Daberath, and went up to Japhia.   <span class="verse">13</span> From there it passed along eastward to Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin; and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to Neah.   <span class="verse">14</span> The border turned around it on the north to Hannathon; and it ended at the valley of Iphtah El;   <span class="verse">15</span> Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.   <span class="verse">16</span> This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.  <span class="verse">17</span> The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children of Issachar according to their families.   <span class="verse">18</span> Their border was to Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem,   <span class="verse">19</span> Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,   <span class="verse">20</span> Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,   <span class="verse">21</span> Remeth, Engannim, En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez.   <span class="verse">22</span> The border reached to Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh. Their border ended at the Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.   <span class="verse">23</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the cities with their villages.  <span class="verse">24</span> The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.   <span class="verse">25</span> Their border was Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph,   <span class="verse">26</span> Allammelech, Amad, Mishal. It reached to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath.   <span class="verse">27</span> It turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon, and reached to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek and Neiel. It went out to Cabul on the left hand,   <span class="verse">28</span> and Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon.   <span class="verse">29</span> The border turned to Ramah, to the fortified city of Tyre; and the border turned to Hosah. It ended at the sea by the region of Achzib;   <span class="verse">30</span> Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.   <span class="verse">31</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.  <span class="verse">32</span> The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for the children of Naphtali according to their families.   <span class="verse">33</span> Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim, Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum. It ended at the Jordan.   <span class="verse">34</span> The border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out from there to Hukkok. It reached to Zebulun on the south, and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan toward the sunrise.   <span class="verse">35</span> The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,   <span class="verse">36</span> Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,   <span class="verse">37</span> Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,   <span class="verse">38</span> Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.   <span class="verse">39</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities with their villages.  <span class="verse">40</span> The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.   <span class="verse">41</span> The border of their inheritance was Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh,   <span class="verse">42</span> Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,   <span class="verse">43</span> Elon, Timnah, Ekron,   <span class="verse">44</span> Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,   <span class="verse">45</span> Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,   <span class="verse">46</span> Me Jarkon, and Rakkon, with the border opposite Joppa.   <span class="verse">47</span> The border of the children of Dan went out beyond them; for the children of Dan went up and fought against Leshem, and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their forefather.   <span class="verse">48</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.  <span class="verse">49</span> So they finished distributing the land for inheritance by its borders. The children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them.   <span class="verse">50</span> According to Yahweh’s commandment, they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and lived there.   <span class="verse">51</span> These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing the land.   <span class="chapter">20</span><span class="verse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,   <span class="verse">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Assign the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,   <span class="verse">3</span> that the man slayer who kills any person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to you for a refuge from the avenger of blood.   <span class="verse">4</span> He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his case in the ears of the elders of that city. They shall take him into the city with them, and give him a place, that he may live among them.   <span class="verse">5</span> If the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver up the man slayer into his hand; because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t hate him before.   <span class="verse">6</span> He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days. Then the man slayer shall return, and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city he fled from.’ ”  <span class="verse">7</span> They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.   <span class="verse">8</span> Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.   <span class="verse">9</span> These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the alien who lives among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands trial before the congregation.

		<span class="reference">Psalms 78:19-39</span>  <span class="chapter">78</span><span class="verse">19</span> Yes, they spoke against God.  They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?  <span class="verse">20</span> Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,  and streams overflowed.  Can he give bread also?  Will he provide meat for his people?”  <span class="verse">21</span> Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.  A fire was kindled against Jacob,  anger also went up against Israel,  <span class="verse">22</span> because they didn’t believe in God,  and didn’t trust in his salvation.  <span class="verse">23</span> Yet he commanded the skies above,  and opened the doors of heaven.  <span class="verse">24</span> He rained down manna on them to eat,  and gave them food from the sky.  <span class="verse">25</span> Man ate the bread of angels.  He sent them food to the full.  <span class="verse">26</span> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.  By his power he guided the south wind.  <span class="verse">27</span> He also rained meat on them as the dust,  winged birds as the sand of the seas.  <span class="verse">28</span> He let them fall in the middle of their camp,  around their habitations.  <span class="verse">29</span> So they ate, and were well filled.  He gave them their own desire.  <span class="verse">30</span> They didn’t turn from their cravings.  Their food was yet in their mouths,  <span class="verse">31</span> when the anger of God went up against them,  killed some of their fattest,  and struck down the young men of Israel.  <span class="verse">32</span> For all this they still sinned,  and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.  <span class="verse">33</span> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,  and their years in terror.  <span class="verse">34</span> When he killed them, then they inquired after him.  They returned and sought God earnestly.  <span class="verse">35</span> They remembered that God was their rock,  the Most High God, their redeemer.  <span class="verse">36</span> But they flattered him with their mouth,  and lied to him with their tongue.  <span class="verse">37</span> For their heart was not right with him,  neither were they faithful in his covenant.  <span class="verse">38</span> But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them.  Yes, many times he turned his anger away,  and didn’t stir up all his wrath.  <span class="verse">39</span> He remembered that they were but flesh,  a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.

Then he came into a house.   <span class="verse">20</span> The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.   <span class="verse">21</span> When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him; for they said, “He is insane.”   <span class="verse">22</span> The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”  <span class="verse">23</span> He summoned them, and said to them in parables,  “How can Satan cast out Satan?  <span class="verse">24</span> If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.  <span class="verse">25</span> If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.  <span class="verse">26</span> If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end.  <span class="verse">27</span> But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then he will plunder his house.

		<span class="reference">1 Corinthians 7:1-16</span>  <span class="chapter">7</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now concerning the things about which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman.   <span class="verse">2</span> But, because of sexual immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.   <span class="verse">3</span> Let the husband give his wife the affection owed her,  and likewise also the wife her husband.   <span class="verse">4</span> The wife doesn’t have authority over her own body, but the husband. Likewise also the husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but the wife.   <span class="verse">5</span> Don’t deprive one another, unless it is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.  <span class="verse">6</span> But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.   <span class="verse">7</span> Yet I wish that all men were like me. However each man has his own gift from God, one of this kind, and another of that kind.   <span class="verse">8</span> But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it is good for them if they remain even as I am.   <span class="verse">9</span> But if they don’t have self-control, let them marry. For it’s better to marry than to burn.   <span class="verse">10</span> But to the married I command—not I, but the Lord—that the wife not leave her husband   <span class="verse">11</span> (but if she departs, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband not leave his wife.  <span class="verse">12</span> But to the rest I—not the Lord—say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to live with him, let him not leave her.   <span class="verse">13</span> The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with her, let her not leave her husband.   <span class="verse">14</span> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.   <span class="verse">15</span> Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us in peace.   <span class="verse">16</span> For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
