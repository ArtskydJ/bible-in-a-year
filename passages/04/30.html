		<span class="reference">Ruth 4</span>  <span class="chapter">4</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by. Boaz said to him, “Come over here, friend, and sit down!” He came over, and sat down.   <span class="verse">2</span> Boaz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here,” and they sat down.   <span class="verse">3</span> He said to the near kinsman, “Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s.   <span class="verse">4</span> I thought I should tell you, saying, ‘Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.’ If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.”  He said, “I will redeem it.”  <span class="verse">5</span> Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.”  <span class="verse">6</span> The near kinsman said, “I can’t redeem it for myself, lest I endanger my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can’t redeem it.”  <span class="verse">7</span> Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his sandal, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of formalizing transactions in Israel.   <span class="verse">8</span> So the near kinsman said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” then he took off his sandal.  <span class="verse">9</span> Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses today, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi.   <span class="verse">10</span> Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brothers and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses today.”  <span class="verse">11</span> All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which both built the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem.   <span class="verse">12</span> Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the offspring  which Yahweh will give you by this young woman.”  <span class="verse">13</span> So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh enabled her to conceive, and she bore a son.   <span class="verse">14</span> The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you today without a near kinsman. Let his name be famous in Israel.   <span class="verse">15</span> He shall be to you a restorer of life and sustain you in your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”   <span class="verse">16</span> Naomi took the child, laid him in her bosom, and became nurse to him.   <span class="verse">17</span> The women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi”. They named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.  <span class="verse">18</span> Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,   <span class="verse">19</span> and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,   <span class="verse">20</span> and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,   <span class="verse">21</span> and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,   <span class="verse">22</span> and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.

Pay back the proud what they deserve.  <span class="verse">3</span> Yahweh, how long will the wicked,  how long will the wicked triumph?  <span class="verse">4</span> They pour out arrogant words.  All the evildoers boast.  <span class="verse">5</span> They break your people in pieces, Yahweh,  and afflict your heritage.  <span class="verse">6</span> They kill the widow and the alien,  and murder the fatherless.  <span class="verse">7</span> They say, “Yah will not see,  neither will Jacob’s God consider.”  <span class="verse">8</span> Consider, you senseless among the people;  you fools, when will you be wise?  <span class="verse">9</span> He who implanted the ear, won’t he hear?  He who formed the eye, won’t he see?  <span class="verse">10</span> He who disciplines the nations, won’t he punish?  He who teaches man knows.  <span class="verse">11</span> Yahweh knows the thoughts of man,  that they are futile.  <span class="verse">12</span> Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah,  and teach out of your law,  <span class="verse">13</span> that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,  until the pit is dug for the wicked.  <span class="verse">14</span> For Yahweh won’t reject his people,  neither will he forsake his inheritance.  <span class="verse">15</span> For judgment will return to righteousness.  All the upright in heart shall follow it.  <span class="verse">16</span> Who will rise up for me against the wicked?  Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?  <span class="verse">17</span> Unless Yahweh had been my help,  my soul would have soon lived in silence.  <span class="verse">18</span> When I said, “My foot is slipping!”  Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up.  <span class="verse">19</span> In the multitude of my thoughts within me,  your comforts delight my soul.  <span class="verse">20</span> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,  which brings about mischief by statute?  <span class="verse">21</span> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,  and condemn the innocent blood.  <span class="verse">22</span> But Yahweh has been my high tower,  my God, the rock of my refuge.  <span class="verse">23</span> He has brought on them their own iniquity,  and will cut them off in their own wickedness.  Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.

		<span class="reference">Mark 9:14-32</span>  <span class="chapter">9</span><span class="verse">14</span> Coming to the disciples, he saw a great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them.   <span class="verse">15</span> Immediately all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, greeted him.   <span class="verse">16</span> He asked the scribes,  “What are you asking them?” <span class="verse">17</span> One of the multitude answered, “Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit;   <span class="verse">18</span> and wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and grinds his teeth, and wastes away. I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t able.”  <span class="verse">19</span> He answered him,  “Unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to me.” <span class="verse">20</span> They brought him to him, and when he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.  <span class="verse">21</span> He asked his father,  “How long has it been since this has come to him?” He said, “From childhood.   <span class="verse">22</span> Often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.”  <span class="verse">23</span> Jesus said to him,  “If you can believe, all things are possible to him who believes.” <span class="verse">24</span> Immediately the father of the child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!”  <span class="verse">25</span> When Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him,  “You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again!” <span class="verse">26</span> After crying out and convulsing him greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead, so much that most of them said, “He is dead.”   <span class="verse">27</span> But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.  <span class="verse">28</span> When he had come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”   <span class="verse">29</span> He said to them,  “This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer and fasting.” <span class="verse">30</span> They went out from there, and passed through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know it.   <span class="verse">31</span> For he was teaching his disciples, and said to them,  “The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise again.” <span class="verse">32</span> But they didn’t understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.

		<span class="reference">1 Corinthians 16</span>  <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.   <span class="verse">2</span> On the first day of every week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections are made when I come.   <span class="verse">3</span> When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">4</span> If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.   <span class="verse">5</span> But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.   <span class="verse">6</span> But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.   <span class="verse">7</span> For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.   <span class="verse">8</span> But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,   <span class="verse">9</span> for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.  <span class="verse">10</span> Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.   <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.  <span class="verse">12</span> Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.  <span class="verse">13</span> Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!   <span class="verse">14</span> Let all that you do be done in love.  <span class="verse">15</span> Now I beg you, brothers—you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints—   <span class="verse">16</span> that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.   <span class="verse">17</span> I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.   <span class="verse">18</span> For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.  <span class="verse">19</span> The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.   <span class="verse">20</span> All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.  <span class="verse">21</span> This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.   <span class="verse">22</span> If any man doesn’t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed.   Come, Lord! <span class="verse">23</span> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.   <span class="verse">24</span> My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
