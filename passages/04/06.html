		<span class="reference">Joshua 11-12</span>  <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, he sent to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph,   <span class="verse">2</span> and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowland, and in the heights of Dor on the west,   <span class="verse">3</span> to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.   <span class="verse">4</span> They went out, they and all their armies with them, many people, even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude, with very many horses and chariots.   <span class="verse">5</span> All these kings met together; and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.  <span class="verse">6</span> Yahweh said to Joshua, “Don’t be afraid because of them; for tomorrow at this time, I will deliver them up all slain before Israel. You shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”  <span class="verse">7</span> So Joshua came suddenly, with all the warriors, against them by the waters of Merom, and attacked them.   <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them, and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim, and to the valley of Mizpah eastward. They struck them until they left them no one remaining.   <span class="verse">9</span> Joshua did to them as Yahweh told him. He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.   <span class="verse">10</span> Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck its king with the sword: for Hazor used to be the head of all those kingdoms.   <span class="verse">11</span> They struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them. There was no one left who breathed. He burned Hazor with fire.   <span class="verse">12</span> Joshua captured all the cities of those kings, with their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded.   <span class="verse">13</span> But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned none of them, except Hazor only. Joshua burned that.   <span class="verse">14</span> The children of Israel took all the plunder of these cities, with the livestock, as plunder for themselves; but every man they struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They didn’t leave any who breathed.  <span class="verse">15</span> As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so Moses commanded Joshua. Joshua did so. He left nothing undone of all that Yahweh commanded Moses.   <span class="verse">16</span> So Joshua captured all that land, the hill country, all the South, all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah, the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;   <span class="verse">17</span> from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon. He took all their kings, struck them, and put them to death.   <span class="verse">18</span> Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.   <span class="verse">19</span> There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon. They took all in battle.   <span class="verse">20</span> For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them, that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them, as Yahweh commanded Moses.   <span class="verse">21</span> Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel: Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.   <span class="verse">22</span> There were none of the Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel. Only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, did some remain.   <span class="verse">23</span> So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. Then the land had rest from war.   <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah eastward:   <span class="verse">2</span> Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the middle of the valley, and half Gilead, even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;   <span class="verse">3</span> and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:   <span class="verse">4</span> and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,   <span class="verse">5</span> and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.  <span class="verse">6</span> Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them. Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.   <span class="verse">7</span> These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir. Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;   <span class="verse">8</span> in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South; the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:  <span class="verse">9</span> the king of Jericho, one;  the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;  <span class="verse">10</span> the king of Jerusalem, one;  the king of Hebron, one;  <span class="verse">11</span> the king of Jarmuth, one;  the king of Lachish, one;  <span class="verse">12</span> the king of Eglon, one;  the king of Gezer, one;  <span class="verse">13</span> the king of Debir, one;  the king of Geder, one;  <span class="verse">14</span> the king of Hormah, one;  the king of Arad, one;  <span class="verse">15</span> the king of Libnah, one;  the king of Adullam, one;  <span class="verse">16</span> the king of Makkedah, one;  the king of Bethel, one;  <span class="verse">17</span> the king of Tappuah, one;  the king of Hepher, one;  <span class="verse">18</span> the king of Aphek, one;  the king of Lassharon, one;  <span class="verse">19</span> the king of Madon, one;  the king of Hazor, one;  <span class="verse">20</span> the king of Shimron Meron, one;  the king of Achshaph, one;  <span class="verse">21</span> the king of Taanach, one;  the king of Megiddo, one;  <span class="verse">22</span> the king of Kedesh, one;  the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;  <span class="verse">23</span> the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one;  the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one;  <span class="verse">24</span> the king of Tirzah, one:  all the kings thirty-one.

Men tell about your wondrous works.  <span class="verse">2</span> When I choose the appointed time,  I will judge blamelessly.  <span class="verse">3</span> The earth and all its inhabitants quake.  I firmly hold its pillars.  <span class="verse">4</span> I said to the arrogant, “Don’t boast!”  I said to the wicked, “Don’t lift up the horn.  <span class="verse">5</span> Don’t lift up your horn on high.  Don’t speak with a stiff neck.”  <span class="verse">6</span> For neither from the east, nor from the west,  nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.  <span class="verse">7</span> But God is the judge.  He puts down one, and lifts up another.  <span class="verse">8</span> For in Yahweh’s hand there is a cup,  full of foaming wine mixed with spices.  He pours it out.  Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.  <span class="verse">9</span> But I will declare this forever:  I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.  <span class="verse">10</span> I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,  but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.

When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was lying on.   <span class="verse">5</span> Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic,  “Son, your sins are forgiven you.” <span class="verse">6</span> But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,   <span class="verse">7</span> “Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”  <span class="verse">8</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them,  “Why do you reason these things in your hearts?  <span class="verse">9</span> Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?’  <span class="verse">10</span> But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” —he said to the paralytic—   <span class="verse">11</span> “I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house.”  <span class="verse">12</span> He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”
