		<span class="reference">1 Chronicles 16-17</span>  <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> They brought in God’s ark, and set it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.   <span class="verse">2</span> When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in Yahweh’s name.   <span class="verse">3</span> He gave to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.   <span class="verse">4</span> He appointed some of the Levites to minister before Yahweh’s ark, and to commemorate, to thank, and to praise Yahweh, the God of Israel:   <span class="verse">5</span> Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;   <span class="verse">6</span> with Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.  <span class="verse">7</span> Then on that day David first ordained to give thanks to Yahweh, by the hand of Asaph and his brothers.  <span class="verse">8</span> Oh give thanks to Yahweh.  Call on his name.  Make what he has done known among the peoples.  <span class="verse">9</span> Sing to him.  Sing praises to him.  Tell of all his marvelous works.  <span class="verse">10</span> Glory in his holy name.  Let the heart of those who seek Yahweh rejoice.  <span class="verse">11</span> Seek Yahweh and his strength.  Seek his face forever more.  <span class="verse">12</span> Remember his marvelous works that he has done,  his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,  <span class="verse">13</span> you offspring  of Israel his servant,  you children of Jacob, his chosen ones.  <span class="verse">14</span> He is Yahweh our God.  His judgments are in all the earth.  <span class="verse">15</span> Remember his covenant forever,  the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,  <span class="verse">16</span> the covenant which he made with Abraham,  his oath to Isaac.  <span class="verse">17</span> He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,  and to Israel for an everlasting covenant,  <span class="verse">18</span> saying, “I will give you the land of Canaan,  The lot of your inheritance,”  <span class="verse">19</span> when you were but a few men in number,  yes, very few, and foreigners were in it.  <span class="verse">20</span> They went about from nation to nation,  from one kingdom to another people.  <span class="verse">21</span> He allowed no man to do them wrong.  Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes,  <span class="verse">22</span> “Don’t touch my anointed ones!  Do my prophets no harm!”  <span class="verse">23</span> Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!  Display his salvation from day to day.  <span class="verse">24</span> Declare his glory among the nations,  and his marvelous works among all the peoples.  <span class="verse">25</span> For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised.  He also is to be feared above all gods.  <span class="verse">26</span> For all the gods of the peoples are idols,  but Yahweh made the heavens.  <span class="verse">27</span> Honor and majesty are before him.  Strength and gladness are in his place.  <span class="verse">28</span> Ascribe to Yahweh, you relatives of the peoples,  ascribe to Yahweh glory and strength!  <span class="verse">29</span> Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Bring an offering, and come before him.  Worship Yahweh in holy array.  <span class="verse">30</span> Tremble before him, all the earth.  The world also is established that it can’t be moved.  <span class="verse">31</span> Let the heavens be glad,  and let the earth rejoice!  Let them say among the nations, “Yahweh reigns!”  <span class="verse">32</span> Let the sea roar, and its fullness!  Let the field exult, and all that is in it!  <span class="verse">33</span> Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before Yahweh,  for he comes to judge the earth.  <span class="verse">34</span> Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,  for his loving kindness endures forever.  <span class="verse">35</span> Say, “Save us, God of our salvation!  Gather us together and deliver us from the nations,  to give thanks to your holy name,  to triumph in your praise.”  <span class="verse">36</span> Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,  from everlasting even to everlasting.  All the people said, “Amen,” and praised Yahweh.  <span class="verse">37</span> So he left Asaph and his brothers there before the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required;   <span class="verse">38</span> and Obed-Edom with their brothers, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;   <span class="verse">39</span> and Zadok the priest, and his brothers the priests, before Yahweh’s tabernacle in the high place that was at Gibeon,   <span class="verse">40</span> to offer burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in Yahweh’s law, which he commanded to Israel;   <span class="verse">41</span> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Yahweh, because his loving kindness endures forever;   <span class="verse">42</span> and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.   <span class="verse">43</span> All the people departed, each man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.   <span class="chapter">17</span><span class="verse">1</span> When David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of Yahweh’s covenant is in a tent.”  <span class="verse">2</span> Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.”  <span class="verse">3</span> That same night, the word of God came to Nathan, saying,   <span class="verse">4</span> “Go and tell David my servant, ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not build me a house to dwell in;   <span class="verse">5</span> for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.   <span class="verse">6</span> In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’ ” ’  <span class="verse">7</span> “Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel.   <span class="verse">8</span> I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.   <span class="verse">9</span> I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first,   <span class="verse">10</span> and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.   <span class="verse">11</span> It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.   <span class="verse">12</span> He will build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.   <span class="verse">13</span> I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;   <span class="verse">14</span> but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be established forever.” ’ ”   <span class="verse">15</span> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.  <span class="verse">16</span> Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, “Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me this far?   <span class="verse">17</span> This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant’s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the standard of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.   <span class="verse">18</span> What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.   <span class="verse">19</span> Yahweh, for your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all this greatness, to make known all these great things.   <span class="verse">20</span> Yahweh, there is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.   <span class="verse">21</span> What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?   <span class="verse">22</span> For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.   <span class="verse">23</span> Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.   <span class="verse">24</span> Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’   <span class="verse">25</span> For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.   <span class="verse">26</span> Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.   <span class="verse">27</span> Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”

		<span class="reference">Luke 8:40-56</span>  <span class="chapter">8</span><span class="verse">40</span> When Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.   <span class="verse">41</span> Behold, a man named Jairus came. He was a ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet, and begged him to come into his house,   <span class="verse">42</span> for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against him.   <span class="verse">43</span> A woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians and could not be healed by any   <span class="verse">44</span> came behind him, and touched the fringe  of his cloak. Immediately the flow of her blood stopped.   <span class="verse">45</span> Jesus said,  “Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, “Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say,  ‘Who touched me?’ ”  <span class="verse">46</span> But Jesus said,  “Someone did touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.” <span class="verse">47</span> When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.   <span class="verse">48</span> He said to her,  “Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.” <span class="verse">49</span> While he still spoke, one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.”  <span class="verse">50</span> But Jesus hearing it, answered him,  “Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she will be healed.” <span class="verse">51</span> When he came to the house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James, the father of the child, and her mother.   <span class="verse">52</span> All were weeping and mourning her, but he said,  “Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.” <span class="verse">53</span> They were ridiculing him, knowing that she was dead.   <span class="verse">54</span> But he put them all outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying,  “Child, arise!” <span class="verse">55</span> Her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat.   <span class="verse">56</span> Her parents were amazed, but he commanded them to tell no one what had been done.
