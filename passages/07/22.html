		<span class="reference">2 Chronicles 14-16</span>  <span class="chapter">14</span><span class="verse">1</span> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son reigned in his place. In his days, the land was quiet ten years.   <span class="verse">2</span> Asa did that which was good and right in Yahweh his God’s eyes;   <span class="verse">3</span> for he took away the foreign altars and the high places, broke down the pillars, cut down the Asherah poles,   <span class="verse">4</span> and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to obey his law and command.   <span class="verse">5</span> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun images; and the kingdom was quiet before him.   <span class="verse">6</span> He built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest.   <span class="verse">7</span> For he said to Judah, “Let’s build these cities, and make walls around them, with towers, gates, and bars. The land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side.” So they built and prospered.  <span class="verse">8</span> Asa had an army of three hundred thousand out of Judah who bore bucklers and spears, and two hundred eighty thousand out of Benjamin who bore shields and drew bows. All these were mighty men of valor.  <span class="verse">9</span> Zerah the Ethiopian came out against them with an army of a million troops and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.   <span class="verse">10</span> Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.   <span class="verse">11</span> Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, “Yahweh, there is no one besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength. Help us, Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name are we come against this multitude. Yahweh, you are our God. Don’t let man prevail against you.”  <span class="verse">12</span> So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.   <span class="verse">13</span> Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and so many of the Ethiopians fell that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh and before his army; and they carried away very much booty.   <span class="verse">14</span> They struck all the cities around Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came on them, and they plundered all the cities; for there was much plunder in them.   <span class="verse">15</span> They also struck the tents of livestock, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.   <span class="chapter">15</span><span class="verse">1</span> The Spirit of God came on Azariah the son of Oded:   <span class="verse">2</span> and he went out to meet Asa, and said to him, “Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin! Yahweh is with you, while you are with him; and if you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.   <span class="verse">3</span> Now for a long time Israel was without the true God, without a teaching priest, and without law.   <span class="verse">4</span> But when in their distress they turned to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and sought him, he was found by them.   <span class="verse">5</span> In those times there was no peace to him who went out, nor to him who came in; but great troubles were on all the inhabitants of the lands.   <span class="verse">6</span> They were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city; for God troubled them with all adversity.   <span class="verse">7</span> But you be strong, and don’t let your hands be slack; for your work will be rewarded.”  <span class="verse">8</span> When Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from the hill country of Ephraim; and he renewed Yahweh’s altar that was before Yahweh’s porch.   <span class="verse">9</span> He gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those who lived with them out of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon; for they came to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.   <span class="verse">10</span> So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign.   <span class="verse">11</span> They sacrificed to Yahweh in that day, of the plunder which they had brought, seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep.   <span class="verse">12</span> They entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their soul;   <span class="verse">13</span> and that whoever would not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.   <span class="verse">14</span> They swore to Yahweh with a loud voice, with shouting, with trumpets, and with cornets.   <span class="verse">15</span> All Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found by them. Then Yahweh gave them rest all around.  <span class="verse">16</span> Also Maacah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed from being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah; so Asa cut down her image, ground it into dust, and burned it at the brook Kidron.   <span class="verse">17</span> But the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.   <span class="verse">18</span> He brought the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, gold, and vessels into God’s house.   <span class="verse">19</span> There was no more war to the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.   <span class="chapter">16</span><span class="verse">1</span> In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s reign, Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.   <span class="verse">2</span> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of Yahweh’s house and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben Hadad king of Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying,   <span class="verse">3</span> “Let there be a treaty between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.”  <span class="verse">4</span> Ben Hadad listened to king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.   <span class="verse">5</span> When Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and let his work cease.   <span class="verse">6</span> Then Asa the king took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Rama, and its timber, with which Baasha had built; and he built Geba and Mizpah with them.  <span class="verse">7</span> At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him, “Because you have relied on the king of Syria, and have not relied on Yahweh your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped out of your hand.   <span class="verse">8</span> Weren’t the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army, with chariots and exceedingly many horsemen? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.   <span class="verse">9</span> For Yahweh’s eyes run back and forth throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. You have done foolishly in this; for from now on you will have wars.”  <span class="verse">10</span> Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.  <span class="verse">11</span> Behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.   <span class="verse">12</span> In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa was diseased in his feet. His disease was exceedingly great: yet in his disease he didn’t seek Yahweh, but just the physicians.   <span class="verse">13</span> Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the forty-first year of his reign.   <span class="verse">14</span> They buried him in his own tomb, which he had dug out for himself in David’s city, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds of spices prepared by the perfumers’ art; and they made a very great fire for him.

With my voice, I ask Yahweh for mercy.  <span class="verse">2</span> I pour out my complaint before him.  I tell him my troubles.  <span class="verse">3</span> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,  you knew my route.  On the path in which I walk,  they have hidden a snare for me.  <span class="verse">4</span> Look on my right, and see;  for there is no one who is concerned for me.  Refuge has fled from me.  No one cares for my soul.  <span class="verse">5</span> I cried to you, Yahweh.  I said, “You are my refuge,  my portion in the land of the living.”  <span class="verse">6</span> Listen to my cry,  for I am in desperate need.  Deliver me from my persecutors,  for they are too strong for me.  <span class="verse">7</span> Bring my soul out of prison,  that I may give thanks to your name.  The righteous will surround me,  for you will be good to me.

The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’?  <span class="verse">8</span> I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs. <span class="verse">9</span> “I tell you, keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep seeking, and you will find. Keep knocking, and it will be opened to you.  <span class="verse">10</span> For everyone who asks receives. He who seeks finds. To him who knocks it will be opened. <span class="verse">11</span> “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he won’t give him a snake instead of a fish, will he?  <span class="verse">12</span> Or if he asks for an egg, he won’t give him a scorpion, will he?  <span class="verse">13</span> If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?”

The dead in Christ will rise first,   <span class="verse">17</span> then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air. So we will be with the Lord forever.   <span class="verse">18</span> Therefore comfort one another with these words.
