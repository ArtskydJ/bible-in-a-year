		<span class="reference">2 Chronicles 33-34</span>  <span class="chapter">33</span><span class="verse">1</span> Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">2</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, after the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.   <span class="verse">3</span> For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he raised up altars for the Baals, made Asheroth, and worshiped all the army of the sky, and served them.   <span class="verse">4</span> He built altars in Yahweh’s house, of which Yahweh said, “My name shall be in Jerusalem forever.”   <span class="verse">5</span> He built altars for all the army of the sky in the two courts of Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">6</span> He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and dealt with those who had familiar spirits and with wizards. He did much evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger.   <span class="verse">7</span> He set the engraved image of the idol, which he had made, in God’s house, of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.   <span class="verse">8</span> I will not any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law, the statutes, and the ordinances given by Moses.”   <span class="verse">9</span> Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did more evil than did the nations whom Yahweh destroyed before the children of Israel.  <span class="verse">10</span> Yahweh spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they didn’t listen.   <span class="verse">11</span> Therefore Yahweh brought on them the captains of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.  <span class="verse">12</span> When he was in distress, he begged Yahweh his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.   <span class="verse">13</span> He prayed to him; and he was entreated by him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that Yahweh was God.  <span class="verse">14</span> Now after this, he built an outer wall to David’s city, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate. He encircled Ophel with it, and raised it up to a very great height; and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.   <span class="verse">15</span> He took away the foreign gods, and the idol out of Yahweh’s house, and all the altars that he had built in the mountain of Yahweh’s house, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.   <span class="verse">16</span> He built up Yahweh’s altar, and offered sacrifices of peace offerings and of thanksgiving on it, and commanded Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.   <span class="verse">17</span> Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only to Yahweh their God.  <span class="verse">18</span> Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.   <span class="verse">19</span> His prayer also, and how God was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places in which he built high places, and set up the Asherah poles and the engraved images, before he humbled himself: behold, they are written in the history of Hozai. <span class="verse">20</span> So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon his son reigned in his place.  <span class="verse">21</span> Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">22</span> He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the engraved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.   <span class="verse">23</span> He didn’t humble himself before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.   <span class="verse">24</span> His servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.   <span class="verse">25</span> But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his place.   <span class="chapter">34</span><span class="verse">1</span> Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">2</span> He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, and walked in the ways of David his father, and didn’t turn away to the right hand or to the left.   <span class="verse">3</span> For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images.   <span class="verse">4</span> They broke down the altars of the Baals in his presence; and he cut down the incense altars that were on high above them. He broke the Asherah poles, the engraved images, and the molten images in pieces, made dust of them, and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.   <span class="verse">5</span> He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">6</span> He did this in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even to Naphtali, around in their ruins.   <span class="verse">7</span> He broke down the altars, and beat the Asherah poles and the engraved images into powder, and cut down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel, then returned to Jerusalem.  <span class="verse">8</span> Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair Yahweh his God’s house.   <span class="verse">9</span> They came to Hilkiah the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into God’s house, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had gathered from the hands of Manasseh, Ephraim, of all the remnant of Israel, of all Judah and Benjamin, and of the inhabitants of Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">10</span> They delivered it into the hands of the workmen who had the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and the workmen who labored in Yahweh’s house gave it to mend and repair the house.   <span class="verse">11</span> They gave it to the carpenters and to the builders, to buy cut stone and timber for couplings, and to make beams for the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.   <span class="verse">12</span> The men did the work faithfully. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to give direction; and others of the Levites, who were all skillful with musical instruments.   <span class="verse">13</span> Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and directed all who did the work in every kind of service. Of the Levites, there were scribes, officials, and gatekeepers.  <span class="verse">14</span> When they brought out the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house, Hilkiah the priest found the book of Yahweh’s law given by Moses.   <span class="verse">15</span> Hilkiah answered Shaphan the scribe, “I have found the book of the law in Yahweh’s house.” So Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.  <span class="verse">16</span> Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, “All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.   <span class="verse">17</span> They have emptied out the money that was found in Yahweh’s house, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.”   <span class="verse">18</span> Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book.” Shaphan read from it to the king.  <span class="verse">19</span> When the king had heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.   <span class="verse">20</span> The king commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,   <span class="verse">21</span> “Go inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is Yahweh’s wrath that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept Yahweh’s word, to do according to all that is written in this book.”  <span class="verse">22</span> So Hilkiah, and they whom the king had commanded, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter), and they spoke to her to that effect.  <span class="verse">23</span> She said to them, “Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Tell the man who sent you to me,   <span class="verse">24</span> “Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.   <span class="verse">25</span> Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath is poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’ ” ’   <span class="verse">26</span> But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, you shall tell him this, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says: “About the words which you have heard,   <span class="verse">27</span> because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me, I also have heard you,” says Yahweh.   <span class="verse">28</span> “Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes won’t see all the evil that I will bring on this place and on its inhabitants.” ’ ”  They brought back word to the king.  <span class="verse">29</span> Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">30</span> The king went up to Yahweh’s house, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and all the people, both great and small; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">31</span> The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.   <span class="verse">32</span> He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.   <span class="verse">33</span> Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that belonged to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn’t depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
