Bring your son here.” <span class="verse">42</span> While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.   <span class="verse">43</span> They were all astonished at the majesty of God.  But while all were marveling at all the things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,   <span class="verse">44</span> “Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men.” <span class="verse">45</span> But they didn’t understand this saying. It was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
