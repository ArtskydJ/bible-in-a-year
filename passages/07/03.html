A reed shaken by the wind?  <span class="verse">25</span> But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.  <span class="verse">26</span> But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet.  <span class="verse">27</span> This is he of whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’ <span class="verse">28</span> “For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.” <span class="verse">29</span> When all the people and the tax collectors heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptized with John’s baptism.   <span class="verse">30</span> But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves.  <span class="verse">31</span> “To what then should I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?  <span class="verse">32</span> They are like children who sit in the marketplace, and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’  <span class="verse">33</span> For John the Baptizer came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’  <span class="verse">34</span> The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a gluttonous man, and a drunkard; a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’  <span class="verse">35</span> Wisdom is justified by all her children.”
