		<span class="reference">2 Chronicles 10-11</span>  <span class="chapter">10</span><span class="verse">1</span> Rehoboam went to Shechem; for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.   <span class="verse">2</span> When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon), Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.   <span class="verse">3</span> They sent and called him; and Jeroboam and all Israel came, and they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,   <span class="verse">4</span> “Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.”  <span class="verse">5</span> He said to them, “Come again to me after three days.”  So the people departed.   <span class="verse">6</span> King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, “What counsel do you give me about how to answer these people?”  <span class="verse">7</span> They spoke to him, saying, “If you are kind to these people, please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.”  <span class="verse">8</span> But he abandoned the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.   <span class="verse">9</span> He said to them, “What counsel do you give, that we may give an answer to these people, who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the yoke that your father put on us lighter?’ ”  <span class="verse">10</span> The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, “Thus you shall tell the people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter on us;’ thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist.   <span class="verse">11</span> Now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.’ ”  <span class="verse">12</span> So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me again the third day.”   <span class="verse">13</span> The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam abandoned the counsel of the old men,   <span class="verse">14</span> and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”  <span class="verse">15</span> So the king didn’t listen to the people; for it was brought about by God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.   <span class="verse">16</span> When all Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, “What portion do we have in David? We don’t have an inheritance in the son of Jesse! Every man to your tents, Israel! Now see to your own house, David.” So all Israel departed to their tents.  <span class="verse">17</span> But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.   <span class="verse">18</span> Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">19</span> So Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day.   <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> When Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the house of Judah and Benjamin, one hundred eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to fight against Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.   <span class="verse">2</span> But Yahweh’s word came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,   <span class="verse">3</span> “Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,   <span class="verse">4</span> ‘Yahweh says, “You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers! Every man return to his house; for this thing is of me.” ’ ” So they listened to Yahweh’s words, and returned from going against Jeroboam.  <span class="verse">5</span> Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and built cities for defense in Judah.   <span class="verse">6</span> He built Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,   <span class="verse">7</span> Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,   <span class="verse">8</span> Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,   <span class="verse">9</span> Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,   <span class="verse">10</span> Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin.   <span class="verse">11</span> He fortified the strongholds, and put captains in them, and stores of food, oil and wine.   <span class="verse">12</span> He put shields and spears in every city, and made them exceedingly strong. Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.  <span class="verse">13</span> The priests and the Levites who were in all Israel stood with him out of all their territory.   <span class="verse">14</span> For the Levites left their pasture lands and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the priest’s office to Yahweh.   <span class="verse">15</span> He himself appointed priests for the high places, for the male goats, and for the calves which he had made.   <span class="verse">16</span> After them, out of all the tribes of Israel, those who set their hearts to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.   <span class="verse">17</span> So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years; for they walked three years in the way of David and Solomon.  <span class="verse">18</span> Rehoboam took a wife for himself, Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David and of Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse.   <span class="verse">19</span> She bore him sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.   <span class="verse">20</span> After her, he took Maacah the daughter of Absalom; and she bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.   <span class="verse">21</span> Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines; for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and became the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.   <span class="verse">22</span> Rehoboam appointed Abijah the son of Maacah to be chief, the prince among his brothers; for he intended to make him king.   <span class="verse">23</span> He dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, to every fortified city. He gave them food in abundance and he sought many wives for them.

Preserve me from the violent man:  <span class="verse">2</span> those who devise mischief in their hearts.  They continually gather themselves together for war.  <span class="verse">3</span> They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.  Viper’s poison is under their lips.  <span class="verse">4</span> Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked.  Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.  <span class="verse">5</span> The proud have hidden a snare for me,  they have spread the cords of a net by the path.  They have set traps for me.  <span class="verse">6</span> I said to Yahweh, “You are my God.”  Listen to the cry of my petitions, Yahweh.  <span class="verse">7</span> Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation,  you have covered my head in the day of battle.  <span class="verse">8</span> Yahweh, don’t grant the desires of the wicked.  Don’t let their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud.  <span class="verse">9</span> As for the head of those who surround me,  let the mischief of their own lips cover them.  <span class="verse">10</span> Let burning coals fall on them.  Let them be thrown into the fire,  into miry pits, from where they never rise.  <span class="verse">11</span> An evil speaker won’t be established in the earth.  Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.  <span class="verse">12</span> I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted,  and justice for the needy.  <span class="verse">13</span> Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.  The upright will dwell in your presence.

Ask her therefore to help me.”  <span class="verse">41</span> Jesus answered her,  “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things,  <span class="verse">42</span> but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.”
