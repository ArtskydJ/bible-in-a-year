		<span class="reference">2 Kings 11-12</span>  <span class="chapter">11</span><span class="verse">1</span> Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal offspring.   <span class="verse">2</span> But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king’s sons who were slain, even him and his nurse, and put them in the bedroom; and they hid him from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.   <span class="verse">3</span> He was with her hidden in Yahweh’s house six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.   <span class="verse">4</span> In the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard, and brought them to him into Yahweh’s house; and he made a covenant with them, and made a covenant with them in Yahweh’s house, and showed them the king’s son.   <span class="verse">5</span> He commanded them, saying, “This is what you must do: a third of you, who come in on the Sabbath, shall be keepers of the watch of the king’s house;   <span class="verse">6</span> a third of you shall be at the gate Sur; and a third of you at the gate behind the guard. So you shall keep the watch of the house, and be a barrier.   <span class="verse">7</span> The two companies of you, even all who go out on the Sabbath, shall keep the watch of Yahweh’s house around the king.   <span class="verse">8</span> You shall surround the king, every man with his weapons in his hand; and he who comes within the ranks, let him be slain. Be with the king when he goes out, and when he comes in.”  <span class="verse">9</span> The captains over hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded; and they each took his men, those who were to come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.   <span class="verse">10</span> The priest delivered to the captains over hundreds the spears and shields that had been king David’s, which were in Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">11</span> The guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, around the king.   <span class="verse">12</span> Then he brought out the king’s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the covenant; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, “Long live the king!”  <span class="verse">13</span> When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into Yahweh’s house:   <span class="verse">14</span> and she looked, and behold, the king stood by the pillar, as the tradition was, with the captains and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes, and cried, “Treason! Treason!”  <span class="verse">15</span> Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of hundreds who were set over the army, and said to them, “Bring her out between the ranks. Kill anyone who follows her with the sword.” For the priest said, “Don’t let her be slain in Yahweh’s house.”   <span class="verse">16</span> So they made way for her; and she went by the way of the horses’ entry to the king’s house, and she was slain there.   <span class="verse">17</span> Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh and the king and the people, that they should be Yahweh’s people; also between the king and the people.   <span class="verse">18</span> All the people of the land went to the house of Baal, and broke it down. They broke his altars and his images in pieces thoroughly, and killed Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. The priest appointed officers over Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">19</span> He took the captains over hundreds, and the Carites, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from Yahweh’s house, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king’s house. He sat on the throne of the kings.   <span class="verse">20</span> So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet. They had slain Athaliah with the sword at the king’s house.  <span class="verse">21</span> Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.   <span class="chapter">12</span><span class="verse">1</span> Jehoash began to reign in the seventh year of Jehu, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.   <span class="verse">2</span> Jehoash did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.   <span class="verse">3</span> However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.   <span class="verse">4</span> Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money of the holy things that is brought into Yahweh’s house, in current money, the money of the people for whom each man is evaluated,  and all the money that it comes into any man’s heart to bring into Yahweh’s house,   <span class="verse">5</span> let the priests take it to them, each man from his donor; and they shall repair the damage to the house, wherever any damage is found.”  <span class="verse">6</span> But it was so, that in the twenty-third year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the damage to the house.   <span class="verse">7</span> Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and for the other priests, and said to them, “Why don’t you repair the damage to the house? Now therefore take no more money from your treasurers, but deliver it for repair of the damage to the house.”  <span class="verse">8</span> The priests consented that they should take no more money from the people, and not repair the damage to the house.   <span class="verse">9</span> But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in its lid, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into Yahweh’s house; and the priests who kept the threshold put all the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house into it.   <span class="verse">10</span> When they saw that there was much money in the chest, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up, and they put it in bags and counted the money that was found in Yahweh’s house.   <span class="verse">11</span> They gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, who had the oversight of Yahweh’s house; and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, who worked on Yahweh’s house,   <span class="verse">12</span> and to the masons and the stone cutters, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the damage to Yahweh’s house, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.   <span class="verse">13</span> But there were not made for Yahweh’s house cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into Yahweh’s house;   <span class="verse">14</span> for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired Yahweh’s house with it.   <span class="verse">15</span> Moreover they didn’t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.   <span class="verse">16</span> The money for the trespass offerings, and the money for the sin offerings was not brought into Yahweh’s house. It was the priests’.  <span class="verse">17</span> Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">18</span> Jehoash king of Judah took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own holy things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and of the king’s house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria; and he went away from Jerusalem.   <span class="verse">19</span> Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?   <span class="verse">20</span> His servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla.   <span class="verse">21</span> For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in David’s city; and Amaziah his son reigned in his place.

There was a great crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them.   <span class="verse">30</span> Their scribes and the Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”   <span class="verse">31</span> Jesus answered them,  “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.  <span class="verse">32</span> I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”
